Commuters









It´s time to rethink your ride with CRRI!
 
































RIPTA’s Commuter Resource RI program (CRRI) helps Rhode Islanders get around the state while saving time, money and the environment. CRRI is dedicated to helping the public navigate RIPTA services as well as providing guidance for using other commuting alternatives such as carpooling, biking and walking to work. We have staff available to come talk to your group, your business, or your school to help people explore all of their commuting options. You can reach our team at commuter@ripta.com.
With our help, your commute is about to get a whole lot greener and more economical.
Get Rewarded
Click here to track your commute and get rewards for not driving alone.  Track the times you have a green commute – whether it’s walking, biking, riding RIPTA, taking the train or carpooling.  The more trips you track, the more points you earn and the more you can treat yourself to discounts on restaurants, retail goods, services and regional attractions.  You can also see how much gas you saved, and search for carpool pals or bike buddies.  It’s all free – just create your own account!
