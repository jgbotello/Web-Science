ANTI-ASIAN RACISM: RESPONDING IN OUR CLASSROOMSThe Center for SEI stands with our faculty and students of Asian descent. We  remind all our community members, and especially all instructors, that acknowledging your concern for students' well-being can play a critical role during these difficult times. Below please find some resources to help support our Asian students and help guide classroom discussion. 









RHODE ISLAND SCHOOL OF DESIGNCENTER FOR SOCIAL EQUITY & INCLUSION








“Without new visions, we don’t know what to build, only what to knock down. We not only end up confused, rudderless and cynical, but we forget that making a revolution is not a series of clever maneuvers and tactics, but a process that can and must transform us.”- Robin D.G. Kelley RISD'S SEI ACTION PLAN
