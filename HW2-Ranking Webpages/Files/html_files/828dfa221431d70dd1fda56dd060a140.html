The Solution




You want your child to succeed. But, in order for that to happen, they need certain types of skills to operate independently. The problem? Your child may have executive function deficits, which makes them feel dependent, overwhelmed, incapable, and disorganized. Every child deserves to function independently and confidently, but I also understand the daily struggle of managing basic routines and completing tasks. That's why I created the Executive Function Journal with over 18 years of educational experience, a Master's Degree in special education, and thousands of private clients.How it works:Buy the Executive Function Journal and Companion Guide. Complete one daily page per day. Strengthen your executive functions with consistent usage. Repeat the cycle.Get started with your first Executive Function Journal now so your child can stop feeling overwhelmed and dysregulated, and start functioning at their potential.
















Your child’s ability to operate independently and succeed confidently is priceless. So are the skills required for them to do so. The Executive Function Journal is available for purchase alone or with the Companion Guide (recommended).The user will start a new Executive Function Journal every 90 days, but will only ever need one Companion Guide. The Executive Function Journal is also available as a 4-pack for uninterrupted usage throughout a full year. Each of the bundles offers a savings discount.This is not just another journal. While the Executive Function Journal is “journal-like” in its appearance and daily usage, the daily pages are unique in their specific targeting of some of the most important skills your child will ever need in life.The daily pages are designed to be accessible and brief (no more than 7 minutes per day to complete).The Companion Guide provides prompts, cues, sentence starters, and alternative questions for all 90 prompts, in order to facilitate journal usage and reduce barriers. It also provides accommodations and instructions for helping a child with various learning disabilities use the journal successfully.
