Old Dominion University's waterfront campus is in the heart of vibrant Coastal Virginia - a prime place to learn, work and play. Approximately 1.75 million people live in the region, which is home to the cities of Chesapeake, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Suffolk and Virginia Beach. Each city has its own unique attractions, events and activities.
Norfolk, a metropolitan city, is home to the world's largest naval base and the North American Headquarters for NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). From internship opportunities with some of the world's top companies, to great shopping and dining, to beautiful beaches, there's always something new to discover. And if you like history or science, you're close to Colonial Williamsburg and NASA Langley, the birthplace of the U.S. space program.
