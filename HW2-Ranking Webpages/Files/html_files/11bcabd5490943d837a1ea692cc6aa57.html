Academic Calendar










Academic calendars are typically published in March for the upcoming Fall term and October for the upcoming Spring and Summer terms, approximately one month prior to the pre-registration period. However, the calendar for any upcoming term will be made available as soon as it is finalized.
The detailed academic calendars for the three most current terms are available below.
Exam schedules for each term are published as soon as they are available; an academic calendar for any term may be published BEFORE exam schedules are ready.
For your convenience, future academic calendars with major dates, and the past ten academic years of detailed calendars are available below.
