An eye-opening account of the significance of written advocacy





While nerve-racking at first, every novice litigator looks forward to their first day speaking in Court.After all, advocacy is our passion. However, it is important to not confine the definition of advocacy to fit within any particular four walls. In my time as an articling student, I saw time and time again how effective a pen (or a keyboard!) can be. Whether it is a carefully drafted email to opposing counsel or a thousand-page “Brief," what a lawyer does outside the courtroom, at their desk, is most often what is needed to successfully advocate for their client’s interest. We always hear statements such as “99% of a lawyer's work happens outside the courtroom” but it takes the perspective that comes from immersing oneself in litigation to understand what it truly means. Almost eight months into my articling term I had an experience that shined a great deal of light on this concept. I was invited to observe an appeal proceeding at the Court of Appeal for Ontario. Excited for the opportunity, I went to the courthouse to observe two of our lawyers make submissions. While I had been to court, both virtually and in person, many times by this point, it was my first time at the ONCA. We entered the courtroom and the first thing I noticed were the pillars that were standing tall at every corner of the room. As everyone prepared to begin, I set down the rather large folder containing Briefs, Factums, Books of Authorities, etc. The court started with the Honourable Justices addressing the other side with a series of questions based on the written documents for over an hour. Then they turned to our side and simply stated that no oral arguments were necessary! While disappointed that I did not get to witness oral arguments being made by our lawyers, I realized I was carrying what resulted in this case's success in my hands all along. In other words, the winning arguments were made long ago by those drafting the factum and other documents. While I always knew written advocacy was important, this experience highlighted just how significant of an impact it can have. Despite this, students get to be a part of this work from day one. So a message to those law students at the beginning of their journey: Your briefs may not be brief, but neither is their impact. by Ali A

My First In-Person Court Attendance 





Since the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual court hearings have become the norm, and in-person court attendances are harder to come by. That’s why when I got assigned to attend Small Claims Court in Burlington in person, I was overjoyed!   
While I have made several court appearances virtually during my articling term, I had not attended any in-person hearings, so I was hit with a wave of excitement. As an aspiring litigation lawyer, I have always dreamt of physically speaking in a courtroom, and here was my opportunity to do so. 
As articling students of a litigation law firm, we are often given the opportunity to attend court, so I wasn’t as terrified going to court as I was the first time. Nonetheless, I made sure that I was prepared and took advantage of all of the information available in the file. I also spoke in great detail to the assigned lawyer, who walked me through everything. Once I felt like I was prepared and had finalized my submissions, I rehearsed them again and again. 
Despite all of my preparation, I was still nervous the morning of. I was worried about all of the things that could potentially go wrong, including not finding the courthouse or getting stuck in traffic and being late for court.  
It definitely felt a little odd having to drive to court instead of joining a Zoom meeting. However, I made sure to leave super early to account for traffic time. I arrived at the courthouse a little earlier than expected which I didn’t mind as it gave me time to rehearse my submissions once more. I entered the courthouse and found the courtroom where my matter was being heard. Once it was my turn, I made my submissions, and the Deputy Judge told me that her endorsement would be sent shortly. I couldn’t believe how smoothly everything went and how quickly it all finished. Getting to physically attend court was a fantastic learning experience and now I can’t wait for my next in-person court attendance! by Chanpreet S.

Running Your Own Trial as an Articling Student





I’ll always remember the day when I stepped into the managing partner’s office, and he said, “Nick, you’re going to trial.”  A rush of adrenaline and nerves flushed through my body.This was a two-day small claims court trial where I was responsible for defending an action brought by homeowners against a general contractor. 

Half the battle was trying to understand the nuts and bolts of construction practices.  I had to spend some time Googling basic carpentry, plumbing and electrical work to familiarize myself with industry standards and Code requirements.  You think I would be a handyman by now!

On the legal side of things, I had to work out a case theory.  To start with, I read the whole file and jotted down notes about things I felt were important.  I did this more times than I care to admit, but I wanted to ensure that I understood the ins and outs of the case and was fully prepared.

The days turned into weeks of trial prep. Countless hours were spent reviewing contracts, emails, photos and invoices to piece together the case like a puzzle.  I had to think strategically about what evidence I wanted to introduce as exhibits to support our defence.  This became a lot easier once I finally had my theory of the case after reviewing the law--a homeowner must give a contractor a reasonable opportunity to remediate any alleged deficiencies in its work before claiming damages.  This is what I built the case around.

The day finally came.  I walked into the courthouse with my banker's box full of evidence, a book of authorities, and a list of questions I prepared for the witnesses. 
I had never been so nervous in my life. However, I felt more settled once things got underway.  I thought, I know the case now I just have to defend it.

Throughout the two-day small claims trial, I had the opportunity to make an opening statement by setting out a roadmap for the deputy judge, cross-examine witnesses, engage in direct examination of our own witnesses, make evidentiary objections where I saw fit, and make closing submissions to the deputy judge by tying the evidence together with the law.

The most important lesson I learned from this experience is that you need to be attentive and adaptable throughout the trial and change your strategy at times, depending on the answers given by witnesses. 
For example, I had to cross-examine a witness on the fly that I did not have any questions prepared for based on new evidence that came to light that I knew I had to challenge.  I asked briefly for the Court’s indulgence and then started my cross, which felt natural because I had my theory and knew what to question the witness about.

The deputy judge reserved his decision.  Regardless of the result, I feel proud and confident knowing I was trusted to put forth the best possible defence for the client.  I now have my first trial under my belt, and it only took being an articling student for it to happen.by Nicholas T.

Learning the Ropes: My First Settlement Conference





As an articling student, you can assume day-to-day carriage of your own small claims court matters. This provides a great opportunity for you to understand the “big picture” of the litigation process by working on a file from start to finish.One small claims case I was working on involved the defence of a negligence claim brought against a medical professional.

The first step was to prepare a defence. Because the timeline to respond to the Plaintiff’s Claim was approaching, we did not want to risk being noted in default by the court. 

Litigation keeps you on your toes by constantly changing your schedule; therefore, it is important to know the timelines outlined in the Rules so you do not miss deadlines. However, it is equally important to be familiar with the SCJ Practice Directions because procedures vary based on where the proceeding will occur. You want to ensure your materials are accepted by the relevant court.

Once this was done, I prepared an initial opinion and budget for the client. At first, I thought this would be a daunting task. I had a general understanding of the standard of care medical professionals are held to; however, I did not go to medical school. How could I decipher medical terminology and procedures? Thankfully, all I needed was my legal background and guidance from the supervising lawyer to draft an opinion regarding exposure on liability and damages. I even took it to another level by recommending the next steps to the client.

The next thing I knew, a settlement conference was scheduled. These are court appearances with all parties where a deputy judge gives an opinion on the claim in an attempt to resolve the matter or at least narrow down the issues.

The day of, I was nervous because I did not know what to expect. What if I was asked something I did not have an answer for? Nonetheless, I felt prepared because I knew the facts of the case and had brief notes on the legal submissions I would make.

At the end of the day, the claim settled! This was a great feeling because it hinged on the legal analysis provided to the client and submitted to the court. Nothing feels better than a deputy judge agreeing with your view of the law. Now, I feel more confident in tackling my next court appearance. Good thing, because I am appearing at another settlement conference at the end of the month.by Nicholas T.

Learn while making a difference





When I told a friend that I would be articling at a full-service litigation firm in the heart of Toronto, he did not hesitate to respond with “Enjoy standing behind the photocopier all day!” While that may be many people’s perception of what students do in firms like MB, here it could not be further from the truth.  My very first assignment, 30 minutes into articling, involved communication with multiple parties in the process of drafting a Statement of Claim. While nervous at first, I knew the detailed training I received was more than sufficient but more importantly that help is ALWAYS one phone call away (or within a few feet). 
Fast forward to today, and looking back at that moment, I can clearly see how many different skills I learned in such a short time. Even though it's only been a few months, I’ve had a chance to be involved in and observe multiple court proceedings including pre-trials, Examinations for Discovery and even Trials, one all the way in London, almost 200 kilometres away from my desk. On any given day, I may walk into the office with my morning coffee and draft claims where we represent the plaintiff. Then after lunch, I shift gears and now I’m drafting documents or preparing for proceedings where we represent the defendant. This diversity makes it possible to learn not just the craft of litigation but to experience both sides of it without the need to change seats! It also makes it possible to learn by doing in a more effective manner. It feels kind of like being a double agent because when I write a defense, I can not only refer to all our resources but also what I was thinking when I was drafting a Statement of Claim and vice versa. Something only possible in this setting. 
All of this is while the work is meaningful. Coming from the legal aid clinical environment, I was used to seeing the impact of my work both in the form of the matters proceeding and the direct impact it had on clients. While there is a learning curve with literally anything a student does, the lawyers are more than happy to go the extra mile by letting the student do the tasks and be a part of the process. Making students a part of the file allows us to see how certain actions taken lead to the next steps. We can also see the different paths a particular case can go with the benefit of the context I got from being involved in its previous stages. 
A benefit of being a student in this environment is there is plenty of room for self-reflection. I remember how long it took me to draft my first Statement of Claim versus how much faster I am today. That said, I still need to figure out where they keep the  photocopier because I’ve been too busy becoming a litigator!by Ali A.

In Hallowed Halls: Selecting a Jury





One of the largest courtrooms I’ve seen. A large, vaulted roof. There must have been eight rows of three long pews. 24 in all. Each one was filled from end to end with people, to the point where they lined up along the back wall as well. In total, there were likely around 150 people in that room. Sitting in the back, I recognized 90% of them, if not more. Why?

Because today was jury selection. And before jury selection, we prepared for everyone. In the week before the fateful day, I had been assigned a new and interesting task. One of the files was heading toward a jury trial and didn’t seem like it was going to settle. To prepare, I had to find out everything I could about the potential jurors. I needed to create a list that the lawyers could use to determine which jurors they wanted and which they did not. 


The first step was going to the Courthouse and getting the jury list. They kept it short and sweet; all I had was the potential jurors’ name and a “listed occupation” (which ranged from “student” to “government”). In short, not much to go on. 


So, I spent two days looking through the list. LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, or good old-fashioned Google. Really, anywhere I thought they could be. With some names, I found nothing. Maybe an author with the same name who wrote a book on advanced mathematics in the 1970s. Maybe a genealogical family history with the same name. Nothing substantial. 


But with other names, there was much more to learn. One individual ran a 10K in under 25 minutes. Another individual sued five different parties in the span of three years. A third individual actually practiced law for several years in another province before moving to Ontario and somehow still made it onto the list of potential jurors. That was certainly a surprise when I found it. It was an interesting assignment, not only trying to identify the right person but also trying to determine what could be important and what would be extraneous. 


What I truly was not prepared for, though, was what happened the next morning. I went in early, but instead of heading to the firm, I went to the Courthouse to join the lawyers there. On that day, the jury selection room, despite its size, was filled to the brim with people. Walking in, I saw someone I recognized, but I could not remember where I recognized them from. Then I recognized another. And another. Until I realized they were not people I knew but forgot about; they were the jurors that I had researched and reviewed. It truly is an odd feeling to recognize people who would never recognize you. 


This left me sitting in the Courtroom during jury selection, watching the process alongside 150 other potential jurors, Lawyers, Court Staff and the Judge. For each juror, the Registrar would spin an old wooden box with the name of each juror inside. He would then pull a name, read it out, and the juror would approach. For the most part, it was oddly like bingo. 


At the start, the Registrar did this six times, with six jurors at the front of the Courtroom. Each was asked if they were available for the length of the trial. Most gave reasons to be excused. Some had prepaid vacations. Others had labour contracts they were required to fill; participating in the trial would cause economic hardship. Two older individuals were concerned about sickness and their ability to pay sufficient attention; they were dismissed on compassionate grounds. 


Eventually, six jurors were in the jury box. At this time, the Lawyers looked them over and started exercising their peremptory challenges, dismissing jurors that they believed would not weigh in their favour. And so, the cycle continued. Jurors were called; some gave excuses and were dismissed, while others were dismissed by peremptory challenges. 


It took 41 jurors to finalize the six jurors and two alternates for the trial. 150 jurors were called, 41 were excused, eight were selected, and in the end, six participated in the trial.by Max G.

A Recipe for Success: The Similar Challenges of Articling and Starting Law School





As I began my journey as an articling student, I quickly realized that all the same feelings I had when starting 1L came back to hit me like a brick wall.  The excitement of starting a new chapter in my life, the nerves associated with the what-ifs and of course, the unrelenting sense of existential dread wondering if I really have what it takes to be a lawyer. "These were only a handful of the many emotions I felt during both these new beginnings."

The best word of advice I can give to those finishing law school is that the transition to practice isn’t exactly going to be smooth sailing.  But remember– you made it this far already– which likely means that you already have all that is needed in your figurative “legal kitchen cabinet” to whip up a recipe for success.

Here’s what you’ll need… 

Two Cups of Organization and AdaptationIn law school, you quickly get into the habit of staying on top of your readings, going to class and creating summaries for exams.  As an articling student, you will need that same level of routine and organization.  You’ll have to get into a pattern of checking in with the next steps for files, docketing your time, answering emails, etc. or else you’ll feel scrambled.  Remember those growing pains with the first few weeks of adjusting to life as a law student, well, the same thing is going to happen when you start articling.  You’ll get into the swing of things in no time but expect the unexpected.  You never know when an urgent assignment will force you out of your element just like a professor cold calling you in class.  This will be no problem if you add a bit of adaptability into the mix.  Equal Parts Trying New Things and Learning How to FailThe bread and butter at MB is insurance defence but there is a whole bunch of other work that comes through the door.  Test the waters because this is the time to figure out where you want to focus your practice in the future.  Who knows, you may end up loving an area of law you never had a taste of just like that one class in school you put into your schedule because nothing else fit.  Don’t be afraid of trying something new because you don’t want to get it “wrong”.  Grades are no longer your focus and besides, there is never a perfect answer when it comes to the law anyway.  Just do your best, get the easy things right, be reliable and think of how you can add value to advance a file.  
 
A Pinch of Competence and ConfidenceAs a first-year law student, I remember feeling imposter syndrome.  How do I draft a legal memo?  What’s a factum?  How do I approach my first law school exam?  These things become a breeze by the time you complete your studies.  You’ll have the same feelings as you start articling; however, the more exposure you get to basic litigation tasks, the more confident and competent you become in knowing how to tackle whatever assignment comes at you.
 
Garnish With Some Rest and RelaxationAt the end of the day, no recipe is complete if it isn’t made with a little love (or R&R in the case of articling students)! 
In law school, you have deadlines for papers and exams and you will have similar expectations when articling.  I remember like it was yesterday the fall of 1L and the rush of due dates for assignments while trying to balance studying for exams.  Of course, this was followed by the lull of the second semester.  During articling, you will have the same ebbs and flows, so take advantage of the downtime getting ahead on files but also doing things you enjoy.  Yes, you need to work hard and meet deadlines because you are setting yourself up for your future career, but you also need to take time for yourself.
 
As a final thought, just know that you’ll be fine.  Think back to how you developed and grew from your first to last year of law school.  Similarly (and hopefully), things will get easier as time goes on during your articling experience and you get to learn how the law works in practice.by Nicholas T
