    I'm the superior, go up against me and you're a fool
Evade, son - take that advice from Sun-Tzu
You got no crew, don't even know that kung fu
Wheezing harder than an out-of-shape runner with no shoes
If you can't seem to understand, you're too slow
My brain only has one mode, and that's go
Cruising markets for starships and custom car kits
Covert ops like government deals with anarchists
Hardships take their toll, you need to forfeit 
Your future's looking grimmer than Littlefoot in a tar pit
Everything you do is all the same
You're as original as Words With Friends the board game

Cash money, bought me roller blades
Now I'm skating circles all around you like donut glazed
This ain't a phase, I ain't dead like shoegaze
Your lease is almost up, son, I'm counting the days 
Building networks, stars and rings, I'm linked in
I do what it takes to win, like Pinkertons
I'm standing on your shoulders so heavy you need a cane,
You're just a citizen of this cruel existence, I'm the bane
You're compensating, making up bullshit to feel alive
You're faker than the Piltdown Man, so contrived
Spreading fabricated slander in the air like a disease
I got energy to raise degrees, you make it freeze
I'm not here for the money, my toilet paper ain't Gucci
I'll hit ya harder than a punch from Rob Lucci
Don't whine, it's a nod to CP9
Just a simple One Piece line, watch it in your spare time

Yeah, pick your ass up off the floor
I'm done seer so you can just walk right out the door
Your game is ashes, now you just standing there stupefied
ãããªã, you have my permission to die

[[Notes]]
Written, recorded, mixed, and uploaded in about 4 hours. I started around 8:30 this morning when I was bored at work. Vocals recorded on an iPhone 4. Bought the beat from AudioJungle. Mixed in Adobe Audition. The line "I'm done seer" was supposed to be "I'm done here", but I screwed up the delivery. I think I'm cool with calling someone a South Asian fish. Oh, and yes, I realize I pronounced sayonara incorrectly.

I'd have to ask some of my Catholic friends, but I think this makes you a saint.
