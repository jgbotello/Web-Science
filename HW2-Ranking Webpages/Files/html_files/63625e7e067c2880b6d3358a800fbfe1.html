Office of Counseling Services










Need Urgent/Crisis Support? Visit Emergencies.












Although our office name is Counseling Services, we provide more services than our name implies. We support the academic mission of the university by helping students resolve stressful circumstances in their lives that can be a hindrance to their academic goals. We do this through consultation, individual and group counseling, psychiatric services, crisis intervention, and variety of outreaches and workshops for the student body.
Our services are offered in an atmosphere that is welcoming and respectful of all students regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, citizenship or physical status.
Our staff is committed to your success and we are devoted to partnering with you to make your college years a satisfying experience.
