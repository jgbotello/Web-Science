                Podcasting on YouTube
              





                YouTube is one of the most popular platforms for podcasts, with
                a vast global audience of over 2 billion active users. Podcasts
                on YouTube help creators expand their reach and build their
                community while providing monetization opportunities. Podcasts
                are also available in the YouTube Music app, so your audience
                can keep listening or watching on the go.

                "On YouTube, it feels like Iâm talking with you, not at
                youâIâm addressing you 1:1. Youâre not a fly on the wall, which
                is how it might feel on other platforms."

          Increase your podcast's reach with video
        



              Video allows more intimacy with your audience, benefits
              accessibility through body language and lip reading, and allows
              you to get creative with visual storytelling elements. Our
              analysis found that podcasts on YouTube with videoâparticularly
              those featuring hosts on cameraâare performing better than
              podcasts with just static visuals. Donât want to be on camera?
              Donât worry. There are plenty of ways to turn audio into video.
