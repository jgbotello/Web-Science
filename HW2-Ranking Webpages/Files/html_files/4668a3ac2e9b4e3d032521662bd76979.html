Conventional pulsed power applications in biology and medicine have a long history, going back three centuries to Galvani, Volta, and Franklin (Benjamin), and even much earlier. Karl Schoenbach, working here at ODU, drawing on his experience in plasma physics and engineering, began in the 1990s with Stephen Beebe and colleagues at Eastern Virginia Medical School applying to biomedical targets a different kind of pulsed power: very high electric fields — megavolts per meter — for very short times — nanoseconds (billionths of a second). In doing so, he brought together the people and resources required to create a new multi-disciplinary field that includes physicists, engineers, cell and molecular biologists, and physicians.
