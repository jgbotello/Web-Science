Expand Your Community at ODU

Old Dominion University is a vibrant and diverse campus. We embrace our diversity and ensure that we strive toward creating an inclusive and welcoming community. We continue to learn from our differences and demonstrate a richer understanding of fellow Monarchs as well as the world around us.
ODU is ranked:
Among the best in ethnic diversity (U.S. News & World Report)
Top 10 in the country and top 100 in the world for reducing inequality (Times Higher Education World University Rankings)
A top 15 University for African-American student success (Education Trust)

As leaders of diversity, we share a commitment to provide opportunities for faculty, staff and students to share life experiences and build awareness through active engagement in conversations that will systematically build and maintain a culture of inclusive excellence.

"Old Dominion University has a long and proud legacy of commitment to the principles of equality and equal opportunity for all students, faculty and staff. In addition to the quality of education and affordability, many of our students tell us our commitment to diversity played a significant factor in their decision to attend Old Dominion."
- President Emeritus John R. Broderick

ODU implements initiatives that foster an inclusive and supportive environment that values diversity
Old Dominion University recognizes the value and opportunities created by diversity. As a result, the University is committed to its goal of creating and maintaining a climate conducive to success for all its members of the University community. The University is composed of individuals with varied backgrounds and experiences, nationalities, ethnicities, and religions, physical, political, intellectual and emotional differences. These differences, and the way in which these differences are treated, encourages members of the University community to reach their full potential.

The Old Dominion University community is comprised of its faculty, staff, students, and volunteers. Together, members of the University community are responsible for achieving diversity within all parts of campus, within University course work and research, and within areas outside the campus but within the reach and influence of Old Dominion University. Together it is important that we consciously act, as a means to achieve our goals.
