        Working to Serve Underrepresented Populations
            






        Representation in science matters to Lauren Butler who earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology from Old Dominion University in May 2022. Diversity and inclusion are the two factors that initially led Butler to ODU. As an African American woman who is pursuing a career in a field where minorities and women are underrepresented, she found her footing. At ODU she not only found a place of belonging but was introduced to a world full of new possibilities that has led her to a path of pursing research on a doctoral level thanks to a specially designed program.
