This type of age restriction is self-imposed and is not a result of a review by YouTube.
When a video is age-restricted, viewers must be signed in and 18 years of age or older to view it. These videos are not shown in certain sections of YouTube. Age-restricted videos may also have limited or no ads.
When deciding whether to age-restrict content, you should consider whether the content shows:

Violence
Disturbing imagery
Nudity
Sexually suggestive content
Portrayal of dangerous activities

Learn more about age-restricted content.
Videos that you proactively age-restrict are still subject to YouTube's Community Guidelines. If YouTube decides a video should be age-restricted, a permanent age restriction will be applied. This restriction happens even if you also age-restrict the video.

If the video is meant to be an ad, don't use this type of age restriction. It will result in ads being permanently disapproved.
