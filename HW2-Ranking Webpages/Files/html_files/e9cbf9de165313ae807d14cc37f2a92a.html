Literary Festival











            Connections: The 46th Annual ODU Literary Festival
      








            October 1 - 5, 2023
      










“After all, I absorb the world around me, and that’s changing all the time. Just as all the water that was in my body last time we met has now been replaced with new water, the things that make up me have changed too.”
— Sayaka Murata













 

In a time of technological advancements that seem to challenge the very nature of writing and art, we come together to reconnect and reaffirm the transformational and profoundly human act of making and experiencing the written word. Writing or reading, performing or viewing, we reach beyond ourselves and in that process are forever changed. Join us for the 46th Annual ODU Literary Festival, as we celebrate poets, novelists, memoirists, actors, directors and all those who tell the stories that link us together and change the way we understand ourselves and our world.
Dr. Luisa A. Igloria and Kent Wascom
2023 Festival Co-directors
