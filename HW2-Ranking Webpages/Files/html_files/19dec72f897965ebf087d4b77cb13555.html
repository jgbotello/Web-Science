          If your API Client(s) uses any YouTube API Services to permit users to upload videos to
          YouTube websites, applications, services or products, the screen or window in which the
          end user clicks the "upload" button must display the following warning in the language(s)
          available on your API Client(s):
        

          "By clicking 'upload,' you certify that the content you are uploading complies with the
          YouTube Terms of Service (including the YouTube Community Guidelines) at
          [select and insert appropriate URL from following paragraph]. Please be sure not to
          violate others' copyright or privacy rights."
        

          If the upload is performed on a personal computer or other non-mobile device, the
          appropriate URL is

          upload is performed on a mobile device, the appropriate URL is
          http://m.youtube.com/terms.
        



          Subject to this Sections 9.1(iii) and (iv) below, API Client(s) that enable users to
          upload videos to YouTube websites, applications, services or products must provide each
          user the option to upload the videos to the user's own YouTube channel(s). If your API
          Client(s) also allow users to upload videos to your YouTube channel, it must (i) provide
          clear notice of the terms of your license to those videos including a clear notice to
          users that you will now either own or have rights to such videos, and (ii) ensure that the
          option to upload to the user's YouTube channel is featured at least as prominently as the
          option to upload videos to your YouTube channel.
        



          If your API Client (or any part thereof) targets or directs itself to children (as defined
          under applicable law(s) including the U.S. Children's Online Privacy (COPPA) and E.U.
          General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) (referred to herein as a
          "Child-Directed API Client"), (a) you and your API Client must comply with
          Section III.J
            (API Clients Directed to Children) of the Developer Policies including notifying Google
          of the child-directed nature of your API Client; each Child-Directed API Client notified
          to Google as provided in Section III.J.2.b of the Developer Policies or otherwise is
          referred to herein as a "Known Child-Directed API Client", and (b) no YouTube API
          Services write-based actions (such as, but not limited to, uploading content, commenting
          and creating/sharing playlists) taken by users of Known Child-Directed API Client will be
          implemented on YouTube websites, applications, services and products pursuant to
          Section III.J (API Clients Directed to Children) of the Developer Policies.  Please see
          Section III.J (API Clients Directed to Children) of the Developer Policies for more
          information.
        



          If your API Client is not a Child-Directed API Client, you must implement
          one of the following: (a) enable users of your non-Child-Directed API Client to
          designate their content as Made for Kids via your API Client before they can upload
          their content to YouTube websites, applications, services or products; or (b) notify users
          of your non-Child-Directed API Client within such API Client that if they upload
          content to YouTube websites, applications, services or products that is Made for Kids,
          then they must immediately go to YouTube on desktop to declare their content as Made for

Notwithstanding the foregoing, should YouTube or Google Inc. first file a patent infringement claim in a lawsuit against you (excluding a patent infringement claim brought by YouTube or Google Inc. in response to a lawsuit, for example, as a cross-claim or counterclaim), then the non-assert provision in the first sentence of this Section will be suspended only for the duration of YouTube’s or Google Inc’s first patent infringement claim against you (for example, until such patent infringement claim is settled, withdrawn, dismissed, or otherwise disposed of).


24. Termination
Termination.
24.1 Termination by You. You may terminate your legal agreement with YouTube by terminating your access to and use of the YouTube API Services (including discontinuing access to and use by your API Client(s) and those acting on your behalf) at any time.

24.2 Termination by YouTube. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, YouTube reserves the right to (i) suspend or terminate access to, or use of, any aspects of the YouTube API Services by you, your API Client(s) and those acting on your behalf), and (ii) terminate the Agreement (or any portion thereof), as applied to any specific user or API Client, category of users or API Clients, or all users or API Clients at any time. For example, we may need to exercise such rights in instances of your breach of this Agreement, court order, when we believe there to have been misconduct or conduct which may create potential liability for YouTube or its Affiliates. Although we will try to give you reasonable notice, we have no obligation to do so.
24.3 Effect of Termination. Upon any suspension, notice of any discontinuance, or termination (whether by you or YouTube), you will immediately stop accessing and using all YouTube Property and delete all YouTube API Services (including all API Data) and YouTube Confidential Information in your possession or control, including from your servers. At YouTube’s request, you will certify your deletion of all YouTube API Services (including all API Data) and YouTube Confidential Information in your possession or control in writing that is signed by your authorized representative who has the authority to bind you. YouTube may independently communicate with any account owner whose account(s) are associated with credentials assigned to you or your API Client(s) to provide notice of both the suspension or termination of your access to, or use of, the YouTube API Services and the display of any advertisements associated with your API Client(s) (where applicable).
24.4 Termination of Support or Modification Efforts. If YouTube elects to provide you or your API Client(s) with support or modification for the YouTube API Services, this support or modification may be suspended or terminated by YouTube at any time without notice to you, as applied to any specific YouTube API Services user or API Client, category of users or API Clients, or all users or API Clients.
24.5 No Obligation to Provide. YouTube is under no obligation to provide the YouTube API Services. It is solely your responsibility at all times to be prepared to conduct your business and operate your API Client(s) without access to any aspect of the YouTube API Services.
24.6 Survival. The following Sections of these Terms of Service will continue to apply indefinitely even upon any termination or expiration of the Agreement as applied to any specific user or API Client, category of users or API Clients, or all users or API Clients at any time: 1 (Definitions), 2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 (The Agreement), 3.3 (Permitted Access and Use of the YouTube API Services), 8 (Security) to the extent applicable data is in the process of deletion upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, 10.2 (Brand Features and Attribution), 13 (Publicity), 16 (No Implied Rights), 17 (Non-exclusive), 18 (Confidentiality), 19 (Exclusion of Warranties), 20 (Limitation of Liability), 21 (Indemnification), 22 (Injunctive Relief), 24 (Termination), and 25 (General Legal Terms).


25. General Legal Terms
General Legal Terms.
25.1 Entire Agreement. The Agreement controls the relationship between you and YouTube and constitutes the entire agreement between such parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.
25.2 Third-Party Beneficiary. Each Affiliate of YouTube is a third-party beneficiary under the Agreement and is entitled to directly rely on and enforce any right or benefit provided to it under the Agreement. There are no other third-party beneficiaries under the Agreement.
25.3 No Waiver. YouTube will not be treated as having waived any rights by not exercising (or delaying the exercise of) any rights under the Agreement. A waiver will be effective only if YouTube expressly states in writing signed by an authorized representative that YouTube is waiving a specified term of the Agreement.
25.4 Severability. If it turns out that a particular provision of the Agreement is found to be not enforceable, that provision will be modified by the court of competent jurisdiction to the extent necessary to create an enforceable provision that reflects the parties' intention as closely as possible. If that is not possible, it will be deemed deleted and the rest of the Agreement will continue in force unaffected.
25.5 Requesting Agreement Modifications. You may grant approvals, permissions and consents to YouTube by email, but any modifications requested by you to the Agreement must be made in writing (not including email) and signed by both YouTube and your authorized representative who has the authority to bind you (and only if YouTube agrees to such modification).
25.6 Notices. All notices to YouTube must be in the English language, in writing, and sent to our corporate headquarters address listed on our website via first class or air mail or overnight courier, and are deemed given upon receipt.
25.7 Assignment of the Agreement. YouTube may transfer or assign the Agreement, including any rights and licenses granted under it, to a third party, but you may not.
25.8 Relationship of the Parties. You are not YouTube’s legal partner or agent; the parties are independent contractors.
25.9 Change of Control. If you or any party operating your API Client(s) on your behalf experience a change of control (for example, through a stock purchase or sale, merger or other form of corporate transaction), you will provide to YouTube a written notice detailing the change of control within 15 calendar days after the change of control via this form. YouTube will review the completed form and if it is not approved within 45 calendar days after the change of control, your project ID will automatically terminate.
25.10 YouTube Approvals. YouTube may deny or grant any consents, approvals, or permissions that are expressly contemplated under the Agreement or otherwise requested by you at our discretion.
25.11 Governing Law and Venue. The laws of California, U.S.A., excluding California’s conflict of laws rules, will apply to any disputes arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the YouTube API Services. Subject to Section 22 (Injunctive Relief), all claims arising out of or relating to the Agreement or the YouTube API Services will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, California, U.S.A., and you and YouTube consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.
25.12 Limitation on Actions. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND YOUTUBE AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE YOUTUBE API SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.
25.13 Translations. Any local language translation (where applicable) exists for reference purposes only, and only the English version will be legally binding. If there is any inconsistency between the two versions, the English version shall control.
