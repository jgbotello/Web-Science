Reporting content is anonymous, so other users can't tell who made the report.
What happens after I report content?
When content is reported, it’s not automatically taken down. Reported content is reviewed along these guidelines:

Content that violates our Community Guidelines is removed from YouTube.
Content that may not be appropriate for younger audiences may be age-restricted.

To check if a video that you reported has been removed, you can view your Report history.

How to report content
Report a video


YouTube reviews reported videos 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. A video can be reported anytime after it’s uploaded to YouTube. If our review team doesn’t find any violations, no amount of reporting will change that, and the video will remain on our site.

Open the YouTube app .
Go to the video that you want to report.
At the top of the video, tap Settings   Report .
Select the reason that best fits the violation in the video.
Tap REPORT.

Note: To check the status of a video you report, on a computer, visit your Report history. Learn more about your Report history.
