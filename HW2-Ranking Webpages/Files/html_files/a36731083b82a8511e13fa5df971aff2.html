Applied Linguistics (M.A.)


The Master of Arts in Applied Linguistics prepares students to pursue advanced graduate study or to teach for colleges, schools, or businesses in the U.S. or abroad. The program's two concentrations are Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) and Sociolinguistics. Students in the program may also earn a certificate in TESOL and/or use appropriate courses in the program as requirements toward obtaining the Commonwealth of Virginia Endorsement for English as a Second Language.

Creative Writing (M.F.A.)

The Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing is widely regarded as a terminal degree. It is designed to prepare students for careers as published writers in fiction, poetry, or creative nonfiction. Another goal is to prepare students professionally—not only for college-level teaching (the practical vocational goal of most M.F.A. programs in creative writing), but also for careers in literary editing and publishing, or as free-lance writers (magazines, newspapers, reviews, and features).

Criminology & Criminal Justice (Ph.D.)

The Ph.D. in Criminology and Criminal Justice is a sociological criminology program that highlights social inequality and public policy in the study of crime and justice issues. The program produces scholars with strong backgrounds in the substantive areas of criminology, criminal justice, theory, inequality, and policy as well as in methodology and statistics. Designed primarily for students interested in pursuing academic careers, the program also prepares students for research careers outside of academia.

English (M.A.)

The Master of Arts program in English develops competency in literary and textual analysis and in writing. The program offers concentrations in literature, the teaching of English, rhetoric and composition, and professional writing. The program prepares students for further study in English and allied fields; for professional writing and editing; for teaching in secondary schools and colleges; for careers in government and industry; and for other professions requiring analytical, literary, linguistic, digital media, or writing skills.

More







English (Ph.D.)

The Ph.D. in English is an innovative program that integrates writing, rhetoric, discourse, technology, literary, and textual studies. Students may pursue full- or part-time study through a combination of on-campus and distance learning courses. There are four concentrations: Writing, Rhetoric, and Discourse Studies; Literary and Cultural Studies; Technology and Media Studies; and a student-created concentration. This program prepares students for academic careers, as well as other careers in which reading and writing figure prominently.

History (M.A.)

The Department of History offers courses of study leading to the Master of Arts with a major in history. The department also offers a Graduate Certificate in Maritime History.

More







Humanities (M.A.)

The Master of Arts in Humanities promotes interdisciplinary studies with an emphasis on critical theory and cultural studies, allowing students to pursue individualized programs of study that incorporate classes from across departments within the college. There are seven concentration areas that students can choose from: Cultural and Human Geography; Cultural Studies and Critical Theory; Gender and Sexuality Studies; Interdisciplinary Studies; Media and Popular Culture Studies; Philosophy and Religious Studies; and Visual Studies.

International Studies (M.A. and Ph.D.)

Old Dominion University offers M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in international studies through the Graduate Program in International Studies (GPIS). GPIS is an interdisciplinary unit, offering advanced research and graduate training in global problems and transnational issues. Fields of concentration include: U.S. Foreign Policy and International Relations; Conflict and Cooperation; International Political Economy and Development; Interdependence and Transnationalism; Comparative and Regional Studies; Modeling and Simulation; and Cultural Studies.

More







Lifespan & Digital Communication (M.A.)

The Master of Arts in Lifespan and Digital Communication focuses on the study of human communication and digital media as they develop across the lifespan. Understanding and analyzing the inseparable relationship between lifespan communication and digital media is a key to success in most 21st century jobs, particularly in the interrelated employment areas of applied research and policy, community networking and outreach, creative industries, education and training, and health and wellness.

More







Music Education (M.M.E.)

The Master of Music Education degree offers students a choice between concentrations in Applied Performance/Conducting, Research, and Pedagogy. The graduate degree is designed to develop advanced knowledge of broad-based principles and practices in music and music education for application in the public or private school, private studio, or higher education setting.
