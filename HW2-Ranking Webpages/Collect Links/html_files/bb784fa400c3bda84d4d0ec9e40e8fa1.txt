About this Program

The Master of Arts (M.A.) in Applied Linguistics prepares students to pursue advanced graduate study, teach in colleges, adult education programs, businesses, private schools and institutions in the U.S. or abroad, work with private businesses, and the language acquisition needs of second language learners. The TESOL track focuses on questions related to how first and subsequent languages are learned, taught, and assessed in a wide range of real-world contexts. It is also concerned with how language is used by native speakers and second language users as an interactional, social, or cultural phenomenon.




Program Highlights


The TESOL track of the MA Program in Applied Linguistics offers unique experience in: Teaching English for academic and specific purposes (EAP/ESP); Discourse analysis; Intercultural communication; Research-based language analysis and instruction
