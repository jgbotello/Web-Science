About this Program

The Early Start MPA (4+1) is a fast-tracked program designed for highly motivated students to continue their education immediately after their bachelor's degree. It is especially beneficial to individuals seeking work or advancement in the government or non-profit sectors. After receiving their undergraduate degree, students will continue with the Master of Public Administration program, taking courses until completing the required 39 credit hours for the degree. Students can choose to pursue a traditional MPA or concentrations in Multisector Public Service or Non-Profit Management and Governance. The MPA program also offers certificates in Public Procurement and Contract Management and Public Administration & Public Policy. Students can complete the Early Start MPA (4+1) in an intensive year of work.
A potential course of study may include: Up to 12 credit hours in the final undergraduate year; 1-3 classes in the Summer, 3-4 courses in the Fall, and 3-4 courses in the Spring.
The MPA program is flexible and will extend the expected completion time for a student if this proves difficult.
