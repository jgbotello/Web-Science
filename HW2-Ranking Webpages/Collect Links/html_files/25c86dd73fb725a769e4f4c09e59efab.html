These agencies and NGOs are particularly effective at telling YouTube about content that violates our Community Guidelines.
The YouTube Priority Flagger program includes:

A web form that government agencies and NGOs can use to contact YouTube directly
Visibility into decisions on reported content
Prioritized flag reviews for increased actionability
Ongoing discussion and feedback about YouTube content areas
Occasional online trainings

Program eligibility
Government agencies and NGOs are eligible to participate in the YouTube Priority Flagger program. Ideal candidates:

Have identified expertise in at least one policy vertical
Flag content frequently with a high accuracy rate
Are open to ongoing discussion and feedback with YouTube about content areas

Certain organizations, including organizations from countries/regions where there’s a history of human rights abuses or speech suppression, may be subject to further review.
How to join the YouTube Priority Flagger program
If you represent an NGO or Government agency, get in touch with your local point of contact at YouTube or Google.
Tip: Before becoming a Priority Flagger, participants from governments and NGOs must attend a YouTube training to learn about our Community Guidelines and enforcement processes.
Program requirements
The Priority Flagger program exists to help enforce our Community Guidelines. Participants must:

Commit to regularly reporting content that may violate our guidelines. YouTube reserves the right to remove any participant who doesn’t participate significantly in the program.
Be open to ongoing discussion and feedback on various YouTube content areas.
Sign in to YouTube to flag content as part of the Priority Flagger program.
Give their email or the email for at least one individual in their organization who’s the continuous point of contact for the Priority Flagger program. We’ll send periodic emails about the Priority Flagger program to this email address.

All participants in the Priority Flagger program are subject to a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).

YouTube reserves the right to refuse participation in the program, modify program requirements, or suspend the program at our sole discretion.

Flag review process
YouTube content moderators review videos flagged by Priority Flaggers according to YouTube’s Community Guidelines. Content reported by Priority Flaggers is not automatically removed or subject to any differential policy treatment — the same standards apply for flags received from other users. But, because of their high degree of accuracy, our teams prioritize flags from Priority Flaggers for review.
The Priority Flagger program exists exclusively for the reporting of possible Community Guideline violations. It is not a flow for reporting content that may violate local law. Requests based on local law can be filed following the instructions here.
