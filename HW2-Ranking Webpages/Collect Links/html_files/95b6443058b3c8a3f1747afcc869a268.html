About this Program

A degree in physics, with education concentration, is designed for students who are preparing to be high school physics teachers. This curriculum provides a solid foundation in both contemporary physics and in education pedagogy.




Program Highlights


Selected by the University to achieve national prominence, taking advantage of Old Dominion’s proximity (a half-hour drive) to the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), the world’s premier nuclear physics research facility, and the NASA Langley Research Center


The Physics department has grown tremendously in the past 20 years, with double the number of faculty, new teaching and laboratory facilities and modernized computer-based undergraduate laboratories


The addition of the new Physical Sciences Research Building offers substantial opportunities for research to graduate and undergraduate students alike
