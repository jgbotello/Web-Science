About this Program

Further your background and expertise with a doctor of engineering degree in modeling and simulation. The D. Eng. in Modeling and Simulation program focuses on developing the advanced knowledge and skills to enable the graduate to conduct and lead advanced technical projects in an engineering environment. Graduates will have developed the highest possible capability to provide innovative solutions in modeling and simulation engineering endeavors. They will meet the highest standards for advanced level engineering and leadership positions in industry and government.




Program Highlights


Students will have the opportunity to work with our faculty on research projects and gain experience solving real world problems


Students are normally employed full-time in industry, government, or the military in an engineering capacity and have duties related to modeling and simulation. They often are responsible for conducting or leading advanced research and development activities suitable for investigation in an academic environment. They plan to participate in the D. Eng. program on a part-time basis and focus their program project work on job-related problems or investigations.
