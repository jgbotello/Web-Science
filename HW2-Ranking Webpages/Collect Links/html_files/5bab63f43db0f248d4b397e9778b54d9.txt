However, the past few months have been EXTREMELY glitchy. I'd open it and it will freeze, no new uploads will populate, can't post , and it takes multiple attempts at closing & reopening the app + waiting it out to get it to work again. I've been hoping for some kind of update in the app store (I check fairly often) , and none yet. Will rate higher once resolved.75 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoAndrew Rochemore_vert Flag inappropriateMay 5, 2024App is nearly unusable when trying to follow posts for a sporting event. Since the addition of the betmgm information, it takes up over half the screen and can not be dismissed. It really takes away from the experience. I understand posting it upon loading, but it should be dismissable. It takes up over half the screen, and you can only see one tweet at a time.59 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoReid Cartermore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 23, 2024The last few years have been a downside in quality, but this is the worst it's been. DMs always freezing or crashing, completely nonsense ads, AI and bots all over the place, the constant "please try again later" error message for basic tasks that used to function completely fine, and a bunch of added features like video calling that no frequent twitter user would want. Not to mention it's the only app I use that makes my phone overheat, even when I drop the brightness. An absolute shame.1,673 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's newGet ready for the new dark mode, now with 2 options – dim and lights out – and an automatic setting!flagFlag as inappropriateApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailgoogle-play-emails@twitter.complaceAddressX Corp.
