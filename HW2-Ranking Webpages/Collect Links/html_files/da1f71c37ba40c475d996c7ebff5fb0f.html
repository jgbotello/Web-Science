Welcome



Welcome to the website for The Center for Educational Partnerships (TCEP) at Old Dominion University. Our mission is to promote individual and institutional learning that enhances the success of educators and students in Virginia and beyond. We do so by forming sustainable collaborative partnerships with schools, institutions of higher education, cultural institutions, and the agencies that support them. As Executive Director, I am proud to lead a dedicated team. TCEP is fortunate to have faculty and staff members with expertise in a diverse range of issues that are critical for our region, including STEM, professional learning and development, curriculum and assessment design, drop-out prevention, and military child education. TCEP faculty are also accomplished scholars and consultants with a wealth of experience in educational research and program evaluation. We hope you enjoy exploring our site. I welcome the opportunity to hear from you.
Joanna K. Garner, Ph.D.
