Lisanne Lyons
Monday, Apr 15, 2024 at 7:30 p.m.
Diehn Concert Series
Chandler Recital Hall, Diehn Center
“A luminous, flutelike soprano…bright tone and improvisational flair.”- The Washington Post
Sometimes sunshine, sometimes moonlight, Lisanne Lyons’ voice dances through a melody, teasing, inviting you along. A favorite of audiences for years as the featured vocalist for the Air Force Bands, this gifted singer has performed around the world, including a star turn in the national touring company of Cy Coleman’s Tony Award-winning City of Angels. Her solo CD “Smile,” recorded with the John Toomey Trio, drew raves like this one from The Washington Post: "Lisanne Lyons…reminds us of the magic that can happen when the right singer, the right song and the right accompaniment fall into place. Blessed with a luminous, flutelike soprano, Lyons delivers a collection of cheery themes and dreamy ballads particularly well-suited to her bright tone and improvisational flair.”
Lisanne Lyon’s career began immediately following high school as the featured vocalist for the Air Force Bands. During her years in the service she performed and traveled worldwide with the “Norad Command Band, ”Travis AF “Band of the Golden Gate,” and the U.S. Air Force Academy “Falconaires.” She received her Bachelor’s and Master’s of Music and Doctorate in Music from the University of Miami Frost School of Music. As a student, she received two Down Beat “Dee Bee” awards for Best Jazz Vocalist and one for Best Jazz Arrangement. She was also invited to be a featured performer with Joel Grey on the NBC televised Orange Bowl half-time show, “You’ll Get a Kick Out of Cole.” Shortly after school, Cy Coleman selected her to replace Monica Mancini in the national touring company of his Tony award winning “City of Angels.”
Dr. Lyons has performed with the Woody Herman Orchestra, Maynard Ferguson Big Bop Nouveau, Arturo Sandoval, Larry Elgart, University of Miami Concert Jazz Band, Roanoke Symphony, Palm Beach Pops, Las Olas Studio Orchestra, South Florida Jazz Orchestra, Sunrise Pops Orchestra, Sugar Pops Orchestra, Grand Rapids Symphony, Hallandale Pops Orchestra, Ars Flores Orchestra, Gene Krupa Orchestra with Michael Berkowitz, XL Big Band in Sweden, Harry James Orchestra, Artie Shaw Orchestra, and various bands across the country. She has also performed with many of the worlds top jazz artists such as Maria Schneider, Bobby McFerrin, Mark Murphy, Four Freshmen, Mose Allison, Jon Hendricks, Don Braden, Paul Bollenbach, Ted Rosenthal, Ira Sullivan, Duffy Jackson, Jim Pugh, Harold Jones, Dave Berkman, Eliane Elias, Claudia Acuna, Bucky Pizzerelli, Gary Burton, Dennis DiBlasio, John Fedchock, Walter White, Kevin Mahagony, and many others. Lisanne has recorded two solo CD’s, “Right as the Rain,” and “Smile,” with the John Toomey trio. “Smile” was met with critical praise including the Washington Post and Cadence magazine. She is in demand as a performer, adjudicator, arranger, and conductor.

Diehn Concert Series
Monday, October 16, 2023 at 2:00 p.m. Chandler Recital Hall, Diehn Center
 
Itamar Zorman, Violin
Michael Katz, Cello
Liza Stepanova, Piano
The Lysander Piano Trio has been praised by The Strad for its “incredible ensemble, passionate playing, articulate and imaginative ideas and wide palette of colors” and by The Washington Post for “an uncommon degree of heart-on-the-sleeve emotional frankness” and “vivid engagement carried by soaring, ripely Romantic playing.” The group has developed a reputation for exciting programming, finding creative ways to connect well-known masterworks with pieces by lesser-known and underrepresented composers, discovering common threads across cultures and times. The Trio’s debut recording After A Dream (CAG Records) was acclaimed by The New York Times for its “polished and spirited interpretations.” Its most recent album, Mirrors, featuring world-premiere recordings of six works the ensemble has commissioned or premiered, was released in early 2021 by First Hand Records.
In the 2022-23 season, the Trio performs at series around North America including New York’s Central Chamber Series, Connecticut’s South Windsor Cultural Arts, Florida’s Key West Impromptu Classical Concerts and Sanibel Music Festival, Wyoming’s WYO Theater, Lee University’s Presidential Concert Series, and the Chamber Music Society of Edmonton. This spring, the Lysander also launches its new tango-infused collaboration with Argentine bandoneon player and composer JP Jofre, with performances from Washington’s Dumbarton Concerts to Phoenix’s Hayden’s Ferry Chamber Music Series.

Monday, Jan 29, 2024 at 7:30 p.m. 
Chandler Recital Hall
Free Master Class: Tuesday, January 30 at 12:30 p.m., Chandler Recital Hall
Alkemie exists to explore and share the life-affirming and alternative perspectives to be experienced in the sounds of centuries past. Comprised of singer-performers playing over a dozen instruments (including vielles, harps, psaltery, gittern, recorders, douçaines, and percussion), the ensemble has a particular interest in the porous boundaries between the court and folk music of the Medieval period. Grounded in historical performance practice and fed by a love of experimentation, Alkemie’s performance on the Indianapolis Early Music Festival in June 2018 was lauded as “enchanting” and “indicating [the] future health of the field of early music.”
Founded in 2013, Alkemie is based in Brooklyn and also performs nationally; since 2018 they have maintained a partnership with the Medieval Studies program at Fordham University. In addition to growing a series in NYC, Alkemie has been presented by the Amherst Early Music Festival, Arizona Early Music Society, Cambridge Society for Early Music, Capitol Early Music Series, Five Boroughs Music Festival, Johns Hopkins Program in Arts, Humanities & Health, Music Before 1800, and the European Early Music Network virtual Early Music Day festival. Alkemie also curated, recorded, and composed the music for the videogame Pentiment.
This season, Alkemie looks forward to debuting new programs featuring a collaboration with the Grammy-nominated duo Chapter House featuring 12th-century repertoire and the fables of Marie de France ("Call Me Marie"); an indie-rock troubadour collaboration with Charles Mueller and his band table tennis (“Fine Companion”); and a collaboration with medieval luminary and composer Shira Kammen that focuses on the works of Guillaume DuFay ("Awesome is this Place").
Alkemie’s members are also committed to the lively teaching of medieval and Renaissance performance practice and history. Alkemie has been in residence at Fairmont State University and has created workshops and educational outreach programs for the Capitol Early Music Series, Ramaz High School (NYC), and at Fordham University. Alkemie members teach collegiate and amateur students at Case Western Reserve University, Fordham University, the Strathmore Arts Center, Amherst Early Music Festival, Pinewoods, the Baroque Performance Institute at Oberlin, and through the Early Music Access Project.

He is joined by sought-after baritone Ross Tamaccio and collaborative pianist Hsiao-Ying Lin.
