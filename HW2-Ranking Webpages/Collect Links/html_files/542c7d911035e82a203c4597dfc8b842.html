  after I was hired to be the iSchool’s student blogger. Eori just
  graduated from the iSchool, and I chatted with her about her

Student Engagement at the 2024 CPGE Online Student Conference



 


Published: February 11, 2024 by Kesheena Doctor


  Presenting at a conference is a great professional development
  opportunity but can be intimidating for those with minimal
  experience, like students. Student conferences are often limited
  to either the university or, on a smaller scale, a department
  within a university.

  This past fall semester was an extremely busy time for me. Not
  only was I working part time and taking a full course load, I
  also presented at two conferences! For those unaware, presenting
  at a conference takes a lot of preparation and careful planning.

SJSU Designates February 19 as Day of Remembrance of Japanese American Internment in WWII




Published: February 3, 2024 by Matsuko
  Friedland and Nicole Azof


  The SJSU iSchool is proud to share that SJSU President 
  Dr. Cynthia Teniente-Matson has issued a Presidential
  Directive permanently designating “February 19 as a Day of
  Remembrance for the harm done to Americans of Japanese descent
  who were forcibly detained, incarcerated and stripped of their
  possessions under the misguided sense that they posed a security
  risk during World War II”. On February 19th, 1942, President
  Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing
  the U.S. Army to forcefully remove Japanese Americans from their
  homes and jobs. This greatly impacted the lives of Asian
  communities everywhere, including Japanese American employees and
  students processing their own community members and students
  abandoning their studies at San Jose State College. Prejudice and
  hysteria played key roles in the initiation of this order.
