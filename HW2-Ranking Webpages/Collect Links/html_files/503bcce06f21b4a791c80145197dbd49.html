About this Program

The Department of Women’s and Gender Studies is a multi- and interdisciplinary field of study that examines gender in historical and contemporary contexts, with an emphasis on women’s lives and perspectives. A degree in Women's Studies centers the complex intersections of gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, nation, and other identities. By the time they complete their degrees, our students are subject experts in the areas of gender, intersectionality, and equity, with an understanding of what it takes to empower themselves and others to become change makers. This skill set makes our students highly competitive on the job market, as employers increasingly seek candidates with intersectional expertise. Department faculty work closely with students to help them learn how to engage in complex problem solving; connect with others across differences; and engage diverse communities.




Program Highlights


Women’s and Gender Studies prepares students to contribute to a variety of fields—as advocates for justice, human rights, and equality


We offer distinct opportunities to get involved in organizations through internships, service-learning, and professional development series


Our department is supported by an active Friends of Women’s Studies organization that provides four scholarships, a range of events, and networking opportunities


Women’s Studies graduates work in a range of fields—from social work, to law, to education, and international development. This department allows students to learn theories of social justice and apply them to benefit not only women and girls, but in a range of contexts where graduates can promote equality and human rights
