About this Program

Fashion merchandising involves wearing many hats within the fashion industry, sometimes juggling them and sometimes focusing on one area exclusively. The most important functions include product development, production, promoting the merchandise, and buying materials from suppliers. Apparel for men and women are the most common items that fashion merchandisers work with, but they also create and sell accessories, cosmetics, jewelry, and shoes. People in these roles typically work in the field of wholesale/retail or for a textile manufacturer.




Program Highlights


Students learn to research target markets, analyze business results, and develop strategies that effectively meet the needs of consumers.


Students create an in-depth research project in collaboration with a major fashion company.


During the summer between their junior and senior year, students must complete a fashion internship that gives them significant practical experience.
