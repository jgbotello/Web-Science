        Working to Serve Underrepresented Populations
            






        Representation in science matters to Lauren Butler who earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology from Old Dominion University in May 2022. Diversity and inclusion are the two factors that initially led Butler to ODU. As an African American woman who is pursuing a career in a field where minorities and women are underrepresented, she found her footing. At ODU she not only found a place of belonging but was introduced to a world full of new possibilities that has led her to a path of pursing research on a doctoral level thanks to a specially designed program.
            

























 

        Jem Baldisimo Receives 2024 Ecological Award
            






        Jem Baldisimo is pursuing a Ph.D. in Ecological Sciences at Old Dominion University and is a Fulbright Scholar and a Virginia Sea Grant Graduate Student Research Fellow. Recently, she was awarded the Ecological Society of America’s 2024 Katherine S. McCarter Graduate Student Policy Award (GSPA). Because of Baldisimo’s advocacy work and her interest in science policy, she and the other awardees will travel to Washington, D.C., to advance their scientific careers in policy, communication, and career training. She takes being a woman of color in science very seriously and believes her Filipino heritage and her mentors helped shaped who she is today.

        Nasir Freeman is a first-year Old Dominion University student majoring in Computer Science who is also going through the Naval Preparatory Program. Even though he is just beginning his journey at ODU, he has a lot to prove to earn a full scholarship through the NPP, to his family and to himself. Through computer science, coding and ODU’s E-Sports team, Freeman is poised to be a leader as he has plans to enter the
Marine Corps as a Naval Officer.
