The Blue Crab Bowl coordinators are excited to announce that the 26th annual competition will be held at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science on  February 9-10, 2024.
Teams are selected by lottery from all valid Pre-Registration (Statement of Intent) forms submitted by November 2, 2023.  All teams must be registered by their Coach of Record.      
   Competition teams consist of five high school students (four competitors and one alternate) and an adult coach. Who is eligible to participate?  The Blue Crab Bowl coaching and student participation guidelines describe
team composition and coach affiliation and 
behavorial expectations. 
Competition
 In this academic competition, students answer multiple-choice, short-answer, and long-answer analytical questions drawn from scientific and technical ocean science disciplines. Topics covered include biology, chemistry, physics, geology, as well as maritime history, marine policy and current events.  Bowl officials and judges manage the matches and rule on answer acceptability.

Students and coaches are awarded exciting prizes at the 
regional bowl. To receive Blue Crab Bowl prizes, teams must be  present at the competition Awards Ceremony.

 Volunteer recruitment for Blue Crab Bowl begins in the fall.
Volunteers make the Blue Crab Bowl possible. Officials and judges are faculty, researchers, graduate students and staff from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science and Old Dominion University, as well as their colleague institutions and agencies. It takes more than 70 volunteers to make this event the success it is each year.  Join us and inspire the next generation of marine scientists!
