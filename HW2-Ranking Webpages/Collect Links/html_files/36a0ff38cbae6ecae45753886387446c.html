Success Stories











Katie engaged my children, made them feel capable, smart and understood.  She taught them strategies to use for the rest of their lives. After each hour of working with Katie, both of my high schoolers would leave inspired, motivated and happy…about schoolwork! She is a magician.  She specializes in students with executive functioning challenges and is so passionate about their success.Amie, parent







Before meeting Katie, our son struggled with anxiety and found school a constant battle. When he started working with Katie and was given the tools and strategies to work within his areas of weakness, he truly began to thrive. From planning and organization to time management and task initiation, Katie has helped him develop a wide range of essential skills.Not only has Katie helped our son overcome his challenges, but she has also instilled a sense of pride and confidence in him.Carolyn,  parent







Katie Azevedo with SchoolHabits has been instrumental in my son’s academic success. Her expertise has developed his study skills, improved his writing, enhanced his time management and prepared him for academics during and beyond high school. During that time my son has learned how to prioritize workload and minimize procrastination. As a parent, I would highly recommend SchoolHabits to anyone.Melissa, parent







Katie has been my tutor for multiple years, helping me with anything from SAT/AP test prep to college/internship applications. She is always positive and kind, creating a happy and comfortable workspace. Her passion for making every student successful is very evident and is what makes her the best tutor!Caroline, student 







Our daughter had a wonderful experience working with Katie. We saw a significant improvement in her writing skills, her ability to focus and process test questions, and her overall approach to learning. These improved skills translated to higher standardized test scores, school grades, and very well-written college essays. Equally important, our daughter looked forward to every session, as Katie made learning fun. Julie, parent







Katie has a gift for zeroing in on what’s causing a student to struggle. She then teaches effective strategies for overcoming the specific obstacles hindering that student from reaching his fullest potential. My son has become more confident after working with Katie and is now a straight-A student. He knows what type of learner he is and how to tackle note-taking, studying, reading, essay writing, and other assignments or academic tasks in a way that best suits his individual learning style. In a way, Katie’s given my son a map of his mind and how it works. He can now maneuver through tasks more effectively because she’s helped him understand himself.  I highly recommend her.Min, parent

Frequently Asked Questions People Ask Before Joining SchoolHabits University

Yes, I'm confident you can do this. While the program covers a lot of material, I teach the content so that it is easy to understand and implement. Throughout  each module, I offer tools and strategies to empower you to create long-lasting academic and work habits.








            I've tried different strategies before, but nothing worked for me. How do I know that this program will help me?
          










Some of the top reasons students fail to achieve their academic goals include not having a clear plan and not learning from a reliable source. Also, many students find it challenging to stay consistent. In this program, you'll be learning from an industry expert in the field of executive functions and study skills - so you know the information you’re getting is legitimate and backed by science and experience. Also, the program is full of modifications and alternatives to many of the skills, which makes the program ideal for all kinds of learners.

That depends, and there is no correct answer. Each of the 6 modules has between 4 and 7 lessons, which you can watch and listen to at your convenience. It’s recommended that you proceed through the program in chronological order, but there is no set time frame you’re expected to complete the program by. 








            What if I’m not satisfied by the course?

You also learn SchoolHabits’s proprietary framework, the FOMSO 5-tep Study Framework, which lays out exactly what to study, how to do it, and when.








            What type of student is SchoolHabits University for?

If you’re thinking “this sounds amazing but I’m still not totally sure …” then keep reading…















You just want your time back.If you’re sick of feeling like there’s never enough time in the day to complete school assignments, study for tests, and meet all the other obligations of being a student, this course is for you. You feel like just as soon as you complete one task, you’re given another, and that leaves you little time for sleep and non-school activities. You’re tired of the anxiety that comes from feeling like you’re constantly rushed and running out of time.















You know you’re capable of more. Do you ever get the feeling that everyone else around you knows a secret that you don’t know? Do you wonder how other students seem to “effortlessly” earn good grades while you’re spending hours in the library with only meh grades to show for it? You know you are capable of so much more if only you knew how.















You know that investing in SKILLS is the greatest investment of all. Yes, this course is an investment. But the skills you learn inside SchoolHabits University extend so, so far beyond the classroom. Strategies for time management, task management, organization, note-taking, and learning are some of the most valuable skills you could have in any career (and let’s be real, in your life!).
















I know investing in something new can be scary. You might be thinking Is this course right for me? Will this work? Can’t I just keep doing what I’m doing and hope things get easier?The truth is that if you’re on the fence right now, it means that you already know what you’re doing isn’t working. The skills you currently have aren’t cutting it. Just imagine what school could look like 30 days from now… you’re not stressed, you’re not overwhelmed by assignments, you’re organized and your notes are clear and functional. You’re not procrastinating anymore because you’re managing your time and your calendar, and for once in your life, your grades match your study effort. THIS IS POSSIBLE, MY FRIEND! You deserve it.



Still on the fence?














These skills are timeless, invaluable, and the key to unlocking your full academic (and future professional!) potential …















As an educator for nearly 18 years, I have taught the skills, systems and methods you find inside SchoolHabits University to thousands of students. Despite a temporary universal global shift to online learning in 2020, ever-changing curriculums, and evolving technologies, the school skills and study frameworks I teach have remained relevant and steady.Learning content is hard enough, is it not? Being a high school and college student is hard enough, is it not? Of course it is! But the key to making your entire academic experience less stressful and more successful is having the right skills, strategies, and systems in place.I have seen these skills, systems and study methods literally change lives. They can change yours. I’m aware of how “grand” that sounds, but it’s why I do what I do.If you’ve ever wondered how the “smart” kids seem to get good grades effortlessly, while you’re struggling to pull off the bare minimum … OR if you’re one of the “smart” students with good grades but it’s coming at too high a cost (stress, poor sleep, overwhelm), then it’s time you invested in yourself. SchoolHabits University, my friend, is the real deal. Will you have to put in the work? Yep. But everything you want for yourself is on the other side of these 6 modules. What do you have to lose?
