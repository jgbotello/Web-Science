About this Program

The chemical oceanography concentration in the Ocean & Earth Sciences B.S. degree is designed for students considering employment or graduate work in the field of chemical oceanography. Chemical oceanography is the study of the behavior of the chemical elements in the oceans and marine sediments and how they are affected by physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes. Students in the chemical oceanography concentration are strongly encouraged to minor in chemistry by taking the appropriate 300- and 400-level classes in the chemistry department.




Program Highlights


The program provides students with the necessary training for employment with a B.S. in a wide range of federal, state, local and private venues.


The program provides students with the necessary background for graduate work in oceanography, marine science, analytical chemistry, and environmental science.


Small class sizes at the upper division level means students work closely with faculty in their discipline as a part of their undergraduate experience.


The program is unique in the state of Virginia.
