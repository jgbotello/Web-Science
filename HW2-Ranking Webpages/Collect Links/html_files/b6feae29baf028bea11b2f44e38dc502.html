About this Program

The Department of History offers a pathway to achieve both the Bachelor of Arts in History and the Master of Arts in History as part of a single course of study.  This pathway program gives students access to graduate courses during their undergraduate career, and provides an opportunity to acquire both degrees in a much shorter period of time than if each were pursued separately.  The dual-degree program prepares students broadly for modern careers in business, government, and teaching, or for further graduate study in history, law, library science, business, or education. 




Program Highlights


        The Department's academic offerings reflect the diversity of the faculty, and students are encouraged to sample broadly the course offerings that investigate the histories of societies and cultures from across the globe.
            

        The dual-degree program offers you many varied options to expand your horizons beyond the required number of classroom courses for the B.A. and M.A. degrees in history.
            

        The Department offers possibilities for study abroad courses in universities around the world, and with ODU faculty over spring and summer breaks.
            

        Internships in museums, at historical and archaeological sites, and libraries give hands-on practical experience and offer networking possibilities for later employment.
            

        Students also have many opportunities to participate in both undergraduate and graduate-level research, advised by world-class faculty who are experts in their respective fields.
