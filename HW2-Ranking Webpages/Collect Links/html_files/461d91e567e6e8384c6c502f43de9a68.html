Q&As












Taking the Survey
















How do I access the Student Opinion Survey for my course(s)?






Click the "Take Your Surveys" button on this page. You must log in using your MIDAS ID and password. This information is NOT submitted as part of the feedback data. ALL SURVEYS ARE ANONYMOUS.
You can also access your Student Opinion Surveys via your myODU Portal, Canvas or your mobile device.








When can I provide feedback about my course(s)?






Course surveys for each semester are available during the last two weeks of most courses. If you are taking a course that is less than a full semester in length, the Student Opinion Survey for that course will be done during the last few days of class.








Will my instructor know if I completed the survey?






No. Instructors can view the response rates for their courses while the surveys are open, but cannot view any other data. The surveys are administered centrally through Information Technology Services (ITS). ITS is not affiliated with any academic unit and/or faculty.








Can I use my mobile device to answer the Student Opinion Survey?






Yes, the Student Opinion Survey is mobile friendly! You can complete your surveys on the "Surveys" module in the ODUMobile App available for Apple & Android devices or by going to www.odu.edu/coursesurvey on your mobile device.








What are the technical requirements?






This system works best with Internet Explorer (IE) 5.5 or above.
















About the Survey
















Are the results really anonymous?






Your log in information is not submitted as part of the feedback data, therefore all Student Opinion Survey results are 100% anonymous.








If the survey is anonymous, why do I have to log in?






The login is used to:

Verify that you are eligible to complete the Student Opinion Survey
Determine which courses are to be surveyed by you.
Determine which courses have already been surveyed by you.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Your log in information is NOT submitted as part of the feedback data, therefore ALL Student Opinion Survey results ARE ANONYMOUS.








Why are they important?






Student feedback is vital to the content and delivery of courses at ODU. Student Opinion survey results are used by faculty to improve teaching and are a component in the promotion and tenure process of faculty.








What happens to the results?






The survey results are viewed by University administrators and faculty. Information gathered is used as part of the process to improve instruction at Old Dominion University.








How long does it take?






Each class survey typically takes between 3-5 minutes to complete.








Why are they online?






In an effort to streamline the survey process, ODU transitioned to an online course evaluation system in fall 2003. The online system is convenient, efficient and environmentally friendly.








Will instructors be able to see survey results before grades are posted?






No. Survey results are not available until after finals are complete and all grades have been posted.
















Troubleshooting
















Why do I see more than one instructor? Should I provide feedback for all of them?






Submit surveys only for those courses with the correct instructor name. Some courses (such as Nursing) have multiple instructors listed. Please disregard those course listings that you see with an instructor who did not teach you.








Why can't I see all of my course links on the Student Opinion Survey?






This may be caused by one of several issues:

You are not viewing the link during the date range allocated for submitting the Student Opinion Survey.
Some types of courses are not included in the Student Opinion Survey, specifically Independent Studies, Tutorial, Dissertation/Thesis, Lecture/Studio, Programmed Instruction, Computer-Assisted Instruction, Telecourse, Non-credit Instruction and Pre-ISI/Inactive/No Type









Why is a course on my list that I'm not registered for or that I have dropped?






Officially, the University has you listed as "registered" for that course. Please contact the Registrar's office.








What login do I use to complete my course surveys?






You must log in using your MIDAS ID and Password. This information is NOT submitted as part of the feedback data.








How do I get a MIDAS account if I don't have one already?






You can set up both your MIDAS and email account at https://midas.odu.edu.








How do I retrieve my lost MIDAS password or get a new one?






You can change or reset your MIDAS password at https://midas.odu.edu.
