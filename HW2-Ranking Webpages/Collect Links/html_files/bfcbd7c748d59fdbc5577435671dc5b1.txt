                        Having lived in every corner of the country through my service in the U.S. Coast Guard, I’ve often felt out of place. ODU is different – it feels like home.

                        For Shah, the offer to serve as commanding officer of the region’s largest Army ROTC battalion provided an opportunity to return to his roots.

                        At ODU, I never felt out of place. I was able to put age on the back burner.

                        ODU is so diverse. I feel like every time I see a person that's Middle Eastern or from my country I'll be like, ‘Oh, I still have family here as well.’

                        It’s all about one person believing in you, and from there, your confidence grows to chase your dream.

                        I am a  psychology and human services major and I'm a future social worker. Being at ODU has really given me the opportunity to feel more confident going into my future. Being able to work with those who are battling addiction, it really opened my eyes to how I can do more for others.

                        I always see a great hunger for learning to do more with language as a means of expression. In my writing classes, I would like my students to keep experiencing curiosity, the kind that may lead to more useful discoveries for them.
