About this Program

Computer science traces its foundation to mathematics, logic, and engineering. Studies in computer science encompass theory, experimental techniques, and engineering methodology. The computer information science curriculum (offered jointly with the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Information Technology & Decision Sciences) exposes students to aspects of each of these disciplines and fosters an appreciation and understanding of them. Students are exposed to the broad theoretical basis of computer science through lecture and laboratory experience.




Program Highlights


Master of Computer Science in Information and Communication Technology is a joint program with the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Information Technology & Decision Sciences. See the webpage under the Department of Computer Science for details.
