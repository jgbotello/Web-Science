About Me

About Me
I joined Old Dominion University as a Ph.D. student in fall 2019
  under the supervision of Dr Sampath Jayarathna.
  I currently work on researching and developing applications using multi-sensory inputs.
  My research interests include multi-sensory environments, information retrieval,
  data mining and machine learning.
I received my Bachelor’s degree in Engineering from University of Moratuwa
  with major in Computer Science and Engineering in fall 2018.
  I followed Integrated Computer Engineering (ICE) stream at University of Moratuwa,
  through which I was able to gather knowledge in Embedded systems, Robotics and
  Industrial Computer Engineering in addition to core knowledge areas in Computer Science
  and Engineering.I also took classes in advanced topics such as Computer Vision,
  Machine Learning, Data Mining, Information Retrieval and Bioinformatics.
In addition to Bachelor’s degree, I also followed professional qualifications for
  Chartered Management Accountants at Chartered Institute of Management Accountants(UK),
  through which I achieved the Advanced Diploma in Management Accounting.
My work
While at Old Dominion University, most of the work relate with researching and
  developing new information retrieval systems or data mining or machine learning.
  During the recent projects, I worked with different eye tracking devices
  (Tobii, Gazepoint,
  PupilLabs), Computer vision (OpenCV) tasks
  and machine learning tasks.
Most of the time I prefer to use Python for programming
  and most commonly used libraries include NumPy, Pandas,
  matplotlib and scikit-learn.
  In addition, I use Java,PHP, Javascript
  and Erlang.
Prior to Ph.D. program, I worked as a freelance developer to develop mobile and web
  applications using Angular and Android.
I worked as a Trainee Software Engineer and as an Associate Software Engineer at
  Wavenet International (Pvt) Ltd, where I was able
  to work in developing high available applications and to optimize applications to get the maximum throughput.
Recent work
Most recent work was research and the implementation of databases with high availability and throughput as
  a part of my intern work. It helped me to understand a lot of about the internals of the databases and how to fine tune
  them for gaining the best performance. I also work in fields of data mining and machine learning for developing
  applications such as search engines.
I have added experience and simple guides for you to make your databases and applications in a blog series and most
  of the steps would require less or no changes in your application code. ;)
I’ve also worked on a cordova plugin for voice commands using android.
  Hybrid world had no plugin to handle explicit calls for the application through
  voice commands (” Ok Google, Find me bla bla “).
I was able to complete voice commands to a certain extent in the plugin. Including setting alarms, timers and search in app. You can find the
  source code of the plugin at

Feel free to use it in your awesome app, improve it and most importantly let me know your awesome work too. :)
