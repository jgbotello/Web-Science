                  Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)
              



Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)













The National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program encourages the active participation of K-12 educators in ongoing engineering and/or computer science research activities at host universities around the nation. NSF RET Sites include pre- and/or in-service K-12 teachers as participants. Community college faculty are also eligible and encouraged to apply. The goal of the NSF RET program is for K-12 STEM educators to enhance their scientific disciplinary knowledge in engineering or computer science and translate their research experiences into classroom activities and curricula. At the same time, the faculty from the hosting university will deepen their understanding of classroom practices, current curricula, pedagogy, and K-12 educational environments.
Old Dominion University (ODU) has a robust RET program for students wanting to explore STEM & Alternative Energy.










            Training STEM Teachers in Alternative (Biomass, Solar, Wind, & Hydrogen) Energy Research
      













This RET site offers opportunities for high school STEM teachers, working with faculty mentors and industry professionals, to engage in multidisciplinary alternative energy research activities. Through this RET program, STEM teachers, especially those from underrepresented groups, will be trained to develop both experimental and computational research skills, while gaining knowledge of advanced science and technology concepts in alternative energy. RET teachers will be exposed and contribute to the advances of cutting-edge research on alternative energy projects mentored by both faculty and industry mentors.
