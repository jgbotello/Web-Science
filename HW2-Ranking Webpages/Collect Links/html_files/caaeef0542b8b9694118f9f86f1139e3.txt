About this Program

This program leads to eligibility for teacher licensure in Virginia and is available only to individuals holding a baccalaureate degree or completing requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree in chemistry.




Program Highlights


MonarchTeach is an innovative teacher preparation program that allows students majoring in science to receive teacher licensure while still earning their degree in their content area.


There is a unique collaboration between the Darden College of Education & Professional Studies and the College of Sciences at Old Dominion University. Students gain valuable teaching experience beginning their first semester of their freshman year and have access to a dedicated resource room.
