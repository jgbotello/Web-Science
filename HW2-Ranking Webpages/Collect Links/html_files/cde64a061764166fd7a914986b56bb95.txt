About this Program

The Department of History offers a Bachelor of Arts degree that prepares students broadly for modern careers in business, government, and teaching, or for graduate study in history, law, library science, business, or education. The Department's academic offerings reflect the diversity of the faculty, and students are encouraged to sample broadly the course offerings.




Program Highlights


The degree offers you many varied options to expand your horizons beyond the required number of classroom courses. The department offers study abroad courses over the spring break. A very popular study abroad course is the Holocaust in France. Students travel to Paris and trace the route of French Jews to Auschwitz. There are also possibilities for an entire study abroad semester in universities around the world. Internships in museums, at historical and archaeological sites, and libraries give you hands-on practical experience and offer networking possibilities for later employment.


A bachelor’s degree in history will give you invaluable research and analytic skills that will prepare you to enter into several professional fields. Teaching at the secondary level of education is a major career field. You can work as a historian in many large government and commercial organizations. You can use your research skills working in archives. You can also work as a curator in a museum. A very important professional field is serving in the military. A degree in history is also great preparation for a career as a lawyer.
