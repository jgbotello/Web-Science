About this Program

For a select number of exceptionally well-qualified students, ODU has established a linked doctoral program that enables students to be admitted directly into the Ph.D. program upon completion of the baccalaureate degree. This program encourages admitted students to work closely with faculty members and pursue a research experience. The student may opt to obtain the master's degree along the way to the doctorate.




Program Highlights


Engineering students with GPA >= 3.0 can apply for the BME graduate program through a linked B.S./Ph.D. program


Students can take two graduate courses double counted for the B.S. degree and a graduate degree


No need for a formal application such as reference letters, essay, and GRE scores


For B.S./Master programs, students need only 24 credit hours and can start working with a research advisor during their senior year
