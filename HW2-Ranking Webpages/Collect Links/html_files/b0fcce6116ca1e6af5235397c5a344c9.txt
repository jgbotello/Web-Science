LATE REGISTRATION PROCEDURE FOR SPRING SESSION 1 (January 06 -April 22) AND SESSION 2 (January 06 - February 27) CLASSES
January 16 is the add/drop deadline for Spring Session 1 and Session 2 classes. After January 16, students cannot use LEO Online to register for Session 1 and Session 2 classes. Please note that registration overrides do not extend the add/drop period to register in self-service, and the following procedure for late registrations is required:
The student must submit a completed add/drop form including the instructor's permission by signature on the form, for late registration, so we have all the information we need and can process the registration. The completed and signed form can be emailed to register@odu.edu for processing.
HOLDS: If the student has any registration hold, the request cannot be processed, even with instructor permission, while the hold remains on the account.
REGISTRATION ERRORS: When registration errors occur, such as the max hours limit, prerequisite errors, campus restrictions, etc., the registration form will be returned for correction and/or additional permissions may be required.

Important notice to all students: Classes are not dropped for non-attendance or non-payment. Courses must be dropped by the published deadlines for each term/session to avoid tuition/fee charges.
