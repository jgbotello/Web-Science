About this Program

Prepare to thrive in the rapidly evolving fields of computer-aided design and manufacturing technologies in the continuous pursuit of quality products and shorter production cycles.




Program Highlights


Our program carries a particular emphasis in PLM solutions for the collaborative data environment. Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) is an integrated, information-driven approach to all aspects of a product’s life from design inception to manufacture, deployment, maintenance, and disposal at the end of its useful life.

Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Mechanical Engineering at ODU?
Students entering the Master of Engineering program in Mechanical Engineering should meet the minimum university admission requirements Graduate Admission.


The applicant must have earned an undergraduate degree from an accredited university in mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, engineering mechanics, or a closely related discipline, such as physics or mathematics, and must also meet Old Dominion University’s general requirements for admission. Applicants with degrees in disciplines other than mechanical engineering or aerospace engineering are required to complete up to three leveling courses. A remedial study plan will be designed for the applicant by the GPD in order to prepare the student for graduate work in the shortest possible time. The selected courses are subject to satisfying the prerequisites listed in the catalog. If an applicant already has a minor in mechanical engineering or aerospace engineering, then no leveling courses are necessary.
