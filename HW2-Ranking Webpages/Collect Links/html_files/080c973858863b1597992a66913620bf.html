About this Program

The Program takes pride in the international, intercultural, academic, and professional experience it offers to students from all over the world, including Germany, Russia, Slovenia, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, Saudi Arabia, Tunis, Afghanistan, Burma, China, Indonesia, Bolivia, etc. The core faculty who serve the program are dedicated teachers as well as accomplished scholars and researchers, devoted to mentoring graduate students and helping them achieve their academic and professional goals.

Program Highlights


The program offers two concentrations--Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) and Sociolinguistics--which are uniquely intertwined.


TESOL International Association considers a Master's degree in TESOL or related area to be the terminal degree for teaching positions in English as a second, foreign, or additional language.


Students may earn a Certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages and/or use appropriate courses in the program toward obtaining a Commonwealth of Virginia Endorsement for English as a Second Language (ESL) if they already have a teaching license.

American English





When people think of 'American English,' they usually have a standard form in mind. In this course, we focus on the variety of ways English is spoken in the U.S. and the social meaning of that variation. We also discuss language-based discrimination and strategies that can be used to confront it. Models for collecting, describing, and analyzing variation in American English are introduced and applied to real-life situations.
