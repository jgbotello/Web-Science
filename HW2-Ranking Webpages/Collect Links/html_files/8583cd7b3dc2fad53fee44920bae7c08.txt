About this Program

ODU’s Game Design, Development, and Criticism degree is an interdisciplinary major that allows students to specialize in game programming or game design while also learning game scholarship. Our program features a fundamentally entrepreneurial and multiperspectival approach to game studies and gaming, one that is designed to not only teach students the core principles of game development, design, and scholarship, but also to help them understand how to adapt these principles in response to changes in technology, the market, or culture. In doing so, this degree aims to prepare students for careers in both the mainstream and independent gaming industry, in the growing academic field of game studies, or in any number of other related fields.




Program Highlights


Choose from two tracks: Development & Criticism, which focuses on game programming concepts or Design & Criticism, which emphasizes game writing and design


ODU features six student organizations dedicated to game design and gameplay


ODU boasts a well-established, entrepreneurial culture, which is key to successful game-based ventures


ODU is located strategically at the mid-point between Washington, D.C., and Raleigh, N.C., two centers of the gaming industry
