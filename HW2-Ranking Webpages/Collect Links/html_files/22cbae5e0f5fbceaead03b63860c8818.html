Statistical Simulation/Programming Using Statistical Software Packages





This course is a data-based tour of advanced statistical techniques using software packages, exploring a catalog of data sets (simulated or otherwise) spanning a variety of fields and applications, including data suitable for regression, ANOVA, time series modeling, longitudinal data analysis, and multivariate techniques. Approaches will include parametric, nonparametric, simulation, and bootstrapping. SAS and R (S-plus) will be used extensively, with some other specialized products. For writing actual (not packaged) code, PROC IML and R will be used. This is a finishing course for applied statisticians, highly recommended for students planning a career in statistical programming and simulation. Prerequisites: A grade of C or better in STAT 405/STAT 505 and two of STAT 435/STAT 535, STAT 437/STAT 537, STAT 447/STAT 547 and STAT 450/STAT 550.
