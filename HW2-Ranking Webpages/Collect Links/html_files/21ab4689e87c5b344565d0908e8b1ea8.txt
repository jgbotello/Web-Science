The Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA) defines internal audit as "an independent, objective assurance and consulting activity designed to add value and improve an organization's operations." The IIA further states that "it helps an organization accomplish its objectives by bringing a systematic disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of risk management, control and governance processes."
The University Audit Department strives to provide objective and independent reviews of University departments, organizations and processes. At the same time, we are part of the University community and work with other university areas to create reasonable solutions and strategies to address business and compliance challenges that arise. Our primary goals are to aid in the effectiveness, efficiency and overall success of Old Dominion University.
An increasing part of our role is to assist the University in its efforts to become and remain compliant with a wide assortment of federal and state laws, regulations and standards. As such, our office works closely with others around the University to enhance compliance.
