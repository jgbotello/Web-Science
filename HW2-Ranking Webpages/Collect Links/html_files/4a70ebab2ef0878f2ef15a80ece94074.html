About this Program

 Accounting services are becoming both broader and more specialized. The major changes that have occurred in the accounting profession dictate expanded and updated educational programs. The minimum education necessary for the professional accountant cannot be achieved in four years of undergraduate study. Although one may sit for the Uniform CPA Exam with only 120 hours of college credit, the Virginia Board of Accountancy requires one to have 150 semester hours of education to obtain the CPA License. Additionally, the number of fields open to accounting majors has increased dramatically in recent years requiring graduates to complete specialized courses in operational auditing, fraud examination, managerial accounting, taxation, etc. Therefore, the ideal model for a professional accounting education embodies a Master of Science (MS) in Accounting program that augments a broad undergraduate education. The MS in Accounting program at Old Dominion University is designed to accommodate both full-time and part-time students with courses offered in the evenings.
