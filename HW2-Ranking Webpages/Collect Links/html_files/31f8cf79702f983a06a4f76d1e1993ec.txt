The Center for Advising Administration & Academic Partnerships guides undergraduate students through academic challenges and choices, oversees the academic progress of all students and supports faculty advisors.
Our office is located in the Student Success Center. You may contact the office at (757) 683-3699 or advisor@odu.edu.
All degree-seeking students must be advised prior to registering each semester. An advisor degree-plan hold is placed on each student's account -- this block is removed during the advising session.
