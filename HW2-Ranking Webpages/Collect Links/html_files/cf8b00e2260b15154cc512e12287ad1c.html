Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) & Teachers (RET)










Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU)
The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds a large number of research opportunities for undergraduate (REU) students through its REU Sites program. An REU Site consists of a group of about ten undergraduates who work in the research programs of the host institution, and are housed at the host university. Each student is associated with a specific research project, where he/she works closely with the faculty and other researchers. Students are granted stipends and, in many cases, assistance with housing and travel.
Old Dominion University (ODU) has robust REU programs for students wanting to explore Chemistry (Community College Students), Computer & Information Science, Cybersecurity, and Psychology (Transportation).

Research Experiences for Teachers (RET)
The National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program encourages the active participation of K-12 educators in ongoing engineering and/or computer science research activities at host universities around the nation. NSF RET Sites include pre- and/or in-service K-12 teachers as participants. Community college faculty are also eligible and encouraged to apply. The goal of the NSF RET program is for K-12 STEM educators to enhance their scientific disciplinary knowledge in engineering or computer science and translate their research experiences into classroom activities and curricula. At the same time, the faculty from the hosting university will deepen their understanding of classroom practices, current curricula, pedagogy, and K-12 educational environments.
Old Dominion University (ODU) has a robust RET program for students wanting to explore STEM & Alternative Energy.
