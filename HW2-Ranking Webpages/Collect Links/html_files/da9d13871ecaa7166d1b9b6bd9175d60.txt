Jane Case, DNP, APRN-BC
Jane Case, DNP, APRN-BC, has been named associate vice chair for Advanced Practice for the Department of Medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Case, associate in Medicine, previously served as director of Advanced Practice for the Department of Medicine, a position she held since 2013. In her new position, she is now leading the efforts of advanced practice providers in the Department of Medicine.
“I am delighted to continue to advance my work in the Department of Medicine,” Case said. “It is an honor to partner with our physician, administration and nursing colleagues in the department, in addition to our stellar group of advanced practice directors and advanced practice clinicians. I am especially grateful for the forward-thinking leadership of our chair and vice-chairs.”
Case has been a nurse since 1989. She started her career as an ICU nurse at Morehead Memorial Hospital in Eden, North Carolina. She became a charge nurse, then nursing supervisor while pursuing her master’s degree at Old Dominion University.
After graduating as a family nurse practitioner in 1997, Jane joined the faculty at Vanderbilt University School of Nursing and started a primary care practice. Case has been a primary care provider at Vanderbilt since, caring for a panel of more than 3,000 patients. She completed her Doctor of Nursing Practice degree at Vanderbilt in 2010 and transitioned from full-time clinician to her leadership role in the Department of Medicine in 2013.
Case’s professional interest and scholarly work is in preventive care and community health. With a passion for clinical teaching, she has also been honored with awards over the years which include Rockingham County’s Meritorious Service Award in Nursing, North Carolina’s Nursing Excellence Award, Alpha Omega Alpha Teaching Award (VUMC), Top Scoring Outpatient Clinic Awards in 2006 and 2010 by Professional Research Consultants Inc., Clinical Care Leader Award by Vanderbilt School of Medicine Shade Tree Clinic, and the prestigious Tennessee Nurse Practitioner of the Year Award in 2012 by the American Association of Nurse Practitioners.
“Jane is not only an exceptional clinician, but she is a visionary in advocating for excellence, safety, and efficiency throughout the Department of Medicine,” said Bryan Harris, MD, MPH, MMHC, executive vice chair for Clinical Affairs for the Department of Medicine. “Her promotion to associate vice chair for Advanced Practice is a testament to her dedication to cultivating an environment that values the unique perspectives of each member of our faculty and staff.”
