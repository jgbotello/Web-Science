Brief Bio

I am an award-winning assistant professor with habilitation (“agregação”) and researcher with a significant record of peer-reviewed publications and funded European grants. I am the first doctorate researcher in Portugal with a PhD in the area of medical microwave imaging, who initiated the first research efforts in this area at a national level. I was also the youngest COST Action chair, with the COST Action TD1301 (Development of a European-based Collaborative Network to Accelerate Technological, Clinical and Commercialisation Progress in the Area of Medical Microwave Imaging) – coincidently this was the first large international project in the area of medical microwave imaging. Other past and current European funding which I have secured include an internationally-competitive Marie Curie Intra-European Fellowship (FP7), as the main researcher, and a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action Innovative Training Networks (H2020), as a beneficiary, and I have just been funded as Project Coordinator of a Horizon Europe Twinning (Widera). Overall, I obtained ~207k€ in individual fellowships, I have been a key consortium member (as chair and as national beneficiary) in multi-partner projects totalling ~7.85M€ funding, out of which I was the main proposer or main/local Principal Investigator (PI) in projects that accounted for ~2.46Mk€. Additionally, I have attracted ~20k€ of personal funding, and I have led my research group of post-graduate students to obtain ~295k€ in funding. ... More >>
