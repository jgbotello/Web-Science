About this Program

The program is designed for those candidates who do not necessarily have a teaching license but want to get a master's degree in reading. The master's only program is designed to provide professional training in literacy for administrators, literacy coaches, policy makers and elementary and secondary-level teachers in private schools that do not require a teaching license. The non-licensure track is for students who are not interested in obtaining reading specialist endorsement. This track is designed for those students who seek to work in schools, institutions and agencies that do not require state licensure or certification. Many literacy specialists work outside of the traditional K-12 public school classroom. Program study may include an intensive search of the professional literature on literacy or selected field experiences in public, private or governmental reading program that provide literacy services to clients. In addition, candidates tutor struggling readers and aid in the diagnosis and remediation of reading problems. This degree does not provide a Reading Specialist Endorsement.
