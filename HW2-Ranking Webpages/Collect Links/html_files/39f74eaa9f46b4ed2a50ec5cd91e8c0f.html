About this Program

The Leadership major is a flexible academic degree that focuses on characteristics and skills necessary to lead in organizational and social contexts, and emphasizes ethical leadership, legal issues, written and oral communication skills. A goal of this program is to facilitate adult students to complete their degree and as such, there is inherent flexibility in transferring existing credit. A second goal is to provide a valuable program for traditional students who plan to hold leadership positions in a variety of fields.




Program Highlights


Because it is interdisciplinary, this program appeals to wide range of adult, traditional and non-traditional students, including military-affiliated students, who might have vastly different interests and who enter the program with some college credit but may not have completed a degree


The academic and critical thinking skills taught through the Leadership curriculum are valuable on the job as well as navigating modern changes and challenges. 


The required, 9 credit-hour core of coursework in Interdisciplinary Studies will provide an opportunity for highly motivated students to identify and research a problem of potentially high, local and national significance, and for which to provide new knowledge and wisdom to decision-makers.


75% of courses in this major are offered both online and in traditional classroom formats
