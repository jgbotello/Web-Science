About this Program

The Department of Psychology participates in the Virginia Consortium Program in Clinical Psychology.  This unified program is offered jointly by Old Dominion University and Norfolk State University and is accredited by the American Psychological Association.  The combined efforts of these institutions give considerable breadth and depth to this unique program.  Students take classes at both institutions and are engaged in research activities and clinical work throughout their training.  The Program follows a scientist-practitioner training model.  The Virginia Consortium emphasizes the following areas in its training model:  (1) research (2) ethics; (3) diversity, and (4) clinical assessment and intervention. 




Program Highlights


 Students are fully funded with tuition waived


Five year (4+1) program: first two years are largely didactic, although students are involved in research continuously (including a master’s thesis or foundational research project) and begin clinical practica in their first year.


One of our primary goals is for students to become proficient at integrating theory, research, and practice.


The Virginia Consortium provides a systematic sequence of supervised pre-internship practica in which students apply the knowledge and skills acquired in the classroom to clinical settings. 


Faculty at both consortia institutions are involved in teaching and research supervision.
