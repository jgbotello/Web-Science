    X is out of control


I like Elon Musk, but this app is not good for humanity. I was on the app for 4 minutes and I saw a guy get jumped by 6 people, a guy run a red light deliberately, and another fight at a restaurant. How is this good for humanity if everything going viral is violent, illegal, and harmful. This encourages more of this. I get life isn't all sunshine and rainbows, but viral content should be harmful. Bad things happen, but it doesn't mean we should promote it and encourage this behavior by it getting traction. I love Tesla and space X, but X is a depressing nightmare and it feels like it even affects Elon Musk as we heard on his earnings call. This app can still turn around and a way to do that would be to eliminate any viral content that is fighting, running red lights, and robbing people. Ya I saw someone get robbed on the app and it's so sad, but that stuff should be private or else now we have encouraged bad behavior. On another note twitter isn't the only one to blame. I got off Tik tok after the day I saw a dog get swallowed whole by an alligator. It feels like that's where X is heading right now so I'm deleting both of them off my phone.I also have bought the 8 dollar verified and to me it's still not worth it to just be at the top of a fighting viral video.

    Twitterâs inevitable decline


I never liked Twitter before Elon but gosh, he some how made me hate it even more. The reason for this review specifically, however, is the glitch(?) that happens when attempting to change your display name. I personally have 5 twitter accounts (personal & business) so the inconvenience of being locked out of one of my more insignificant ones isnât that bad. However, after troubleshooting, logging out, logging back in, even changing my password, Iâve still been unable to regain access to my account. This wouldnât be much of an issue if I could log into one of my other accounts, but I canât. Thereâs a blank screen with the only button being âoptionsâ. When selected the options are âhelpâ and âsign outâ, which Iâve already attempted. This issue never happened before Elon, at least not to me. The increase in promotional tweets, ads, and paywalled features that were once free have resulted in the downfall of twitter as a whole. I was able to log back into one of my other accounts briefly by opening a dm that was sent to it. As soon as I tried to re-add the account Iâm locked out of, the same black screen appeared. I knew of this issue prior to attempting to change my display name. I had changed my display name on another one of my accounts since hearing about it so I didnât think it would affect me. All in all, my experience with Twitter has been disappointing at best.

    Twitter to X


Hello, I enjoy using the app,âXâ before it was called âXâ. Since I joined in high school this app has been my news source and constant connection to hobbies and topics I love. I enjoy keeping up with my EDM community and upcoming events as well as interacting with my favorite DJs and Producers. Also, when there is a very popular television or movie premiering, people interact and comment on each otherâs post to share their opinions on topics they are interested in such as Game of Thrones for example. People were live tweeting and commenting each scene during the final episode. The registration process was extremely easy, and I loved picking a header for my Twitter page. Since I am a loyal user before Twitter became rebranded as âXâ, recently I noticed Instagram and TikTok took the lead for most used social media app. I am currently doing a research project on this app and trying to figure out how to target Gen Z users to increase their usage on X. My group project barely uses âXâ but besides me, so I guess they barely go on their which means they are not a part of a target market like me. Twitter/X has always be reliable for me and rarely crashes. The increase of Ads and lack of monetarization is dangerous but also overwhelming to look at when I did not follow those pages.
