About this Program

Further your background in modeling and simulation with a master of science degree. Our program prepares students for careers as simulation professionals in government and industry, teachers of modeling and simulation at the high school or junior college level, and for advanced graduate study in modeling and simulation or other related disciplines. The master's degree in modeling and simulation (M&S) emphasizes a strong, common subject core while providing the student with the flexibility to design a plan of study to meet each individual's study objectives and needs. The program's subject core consists of: an overview of modeling and simulation; an in-depth exploration of specific simulation methodological approaches; simulation system modeling principles and techniques; an introduction to computer visualization and visual simulation; and principles of stochastic analysis. This provides the mechanisms for the simulationist to work across disciplines and domains while maintaining a common frame of reference for communication, technical specialization, and advanced study and research.




Program Highlights


Program offers two options: thesis option and course option. The thesis option requires six hours of thesis credit and 24 hours of course credit and it is directed primarily at full-time students who are preparing for a career in advanced M&S research and/or academic positions. The course option requires 30 hours of course credit and it is focused on developing the practical skills and knowledge needed to solve problems requiring applications of modeling and simulation. The Course Optionis further divided into two tracks: Development Track and Application Track. The Development Track is programming intensive and prepares students for advanced simulation development, while the Application Track focuses on the usage of existing advanced simulation tools.

Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Modeling & Simulation Engineering at ODU?
Students entering the Master of Science program in Modeling & Simulation Engineering should meet the minimum university admission requirements Graduate Admission.


The Master's Degree in Modeling and Simulation is designed for students having bachelor's degrees in Engineering, Science or Mathematics, although students from other educational backgrounds may apply with appropriate leveling courses. Prerequisites for admission include: mathematics - two courses in differential and integral calculus and one course in calculus-based probability and statistics; and computer science - algorithmic problem solving using a high-level object-oriented programming language such as C++.




A completed graduate application form


A resume and statement of academic goals and objectives


Transcripts from all colleges and universities previously attended


Recent Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores from the verbal, quantitative and analytical writing tests (GRE letters required of MS application thesis option only)


Two letters of recommendation from previous university instructors or employment supervisors (recommendation letters required of MS application thesis option only)


A minimum GPA of 2.80 overall and a minimum GPA of 3.0 in the undergraduate major are required. Students with notable deficiencies may be considered for provisional admission and will be required to complete prerequisite course requirements in addition to the graduate degree requirements. Job experience and training may be considered in evaluating prerequisite requirements.
