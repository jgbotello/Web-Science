About this Program

Economics graduates are considered generalists who are well-trained in analytical thinking. Majoring in economics is a spring-board to a very wide variety of careers, not only in businesses, but also in government agencies and not-for-profit organizations. A major in economics is also excellent preparation for graduate study toward master's and doctoral degrees in economics, business, public administration, urban studies, international studies, marine affairs and other fields. Furthermore, even many law schools encourage prospective students to consider majoring in economics as undergraduates.




Program Highlights
