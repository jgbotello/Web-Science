About this Program

This certificate program is designed to support provisionally licensed teachers, who are employed by a school division in the Commonwealth of Virginia, in meeting teacher licensure requirements. The certificate consists of four courses* (12 semester hours) that move toward meeting the professional studies competency areas described by the Virginia Department of Education and required by all fully licensed teachers. It is not a state-approved endorsement education program.
*Additional courses may be required for licensure. The Darden College of Education and Professional Studies offers many of the professional studies courses, including the area of Curriculum and Instruction Procedures, and required content courses are offered in the other colleges.




Program Highlights


Courses taught asynchronously online to fit a teacher’s schedule


A relevant curriculum taught by Ph.D. prepared faculty with classroom experience


Apply curricular learning to solve problems experienced in classroom and school settings


Up to 12 credit hours completed for the certificate can be counted toward the M.S.Ed. degree program for licensed teachers.
