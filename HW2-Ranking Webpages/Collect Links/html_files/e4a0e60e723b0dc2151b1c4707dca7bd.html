Welcome
to CS620/DASC600 Data Science.  
Note
that the course content will be
delivered via ODU PLE (Personal Learning Environment) for all the registered students. The recitation section will be delivered via synchronous
Zoom. We
will utilize the recitation time to discuss about the weekly course
content, assignments, class activities and the project work. I'll be
recording the videos and posting them for the folks who are not available
during this time.  I understand some of you are probably
working
and taking the courses part-time, but I want to make sure that the
recitation is not just for the folks registered for the live session. All
of you are welcome to join if that date/time is convenient to
you.
