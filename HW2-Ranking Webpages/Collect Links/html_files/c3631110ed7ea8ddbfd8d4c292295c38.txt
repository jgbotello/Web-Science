Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Biomedical Engineering at ODU?
Students entering the Doctor of Philosophy program in Biomedical Engineering should meet the minimum university admission requirements Graduate Admission.


Completion of a master's degree in a closely related field is expected. However, students who have completed 24 credits of graduate courses in an appropriate field from an accredited institution or have demonstrated an exceptionally high level of academic capability may petition for direct admittance into the program.


Recent scores, typically, not more than five years old, on the Graduate Record Examination's (GRE) verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing sections must be submitted by all applicants.


Three letters of recommendation (typically at least two of which are from faculty in the highest degree program completed when the application is within five years of graduation from that degree program) are required.


The applicant must submit a resume and a statement of purpose and goals.


Foundation knowledge in physics, basic chemistry, computer programming, and mathematics is expected.




More Program and Degree Requirements





For Admission to the Biomedical Engineering Program





        GPA
            



A minimum GPA of 3.50 (out of 4.0) is required of most students. A student with a lower GPA meeting ODU's graduate admission requirements and with evidence of a high level of professional capability may be eligible for admission to the program upon submission of a petition to the graduate program director.
