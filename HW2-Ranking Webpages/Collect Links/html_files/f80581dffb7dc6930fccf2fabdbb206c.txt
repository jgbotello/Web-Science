About this Program

A number of connections have been built between ODU’s Graduate Program in International Studies (GPIS) and the Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center. The M&S in international studies certificate can be pursued by students in several ways, with courses selected in close consultation with the M&S track coordinator. Modeling and simulation in the social sciences generally, and in international studies particularly, takes several different forms, including statistical modeling, formal modeling/game theory, simulation/agent-based modeling, geographic/spatial modeling, network analysis, and event simulation exercises.
