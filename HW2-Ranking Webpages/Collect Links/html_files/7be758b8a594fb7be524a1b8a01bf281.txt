About this Program

The linked BSCS/MBA program is an early entry in the MBA program of study. The linked program is designed for well qualified non-business undergraduates, allowing them to start their MBA program prior to completing the BSCS degree. Students will take MBA-level courses as early as three semesters prior to graduation and count up to 12 graduate credits toward their undergraduate degree. BSCS majors will be able to count the graduate level courses as the technical electives (2) and upper division general education courses (2). A computer science degree prepares students well for the professional workforce as problem solvers. Channel that knowledge to managing a business or organization. 




Program Highlights


        Computer Scientists solve problems for any domain where a software solution is needed. Pair that with in-depth knowledge of Business Administration principals and experience to lead the teams who make everything run.
            

        A strong mathematics and science based program is well suited to prepare students to become leaders in a business environment.
            

        Software solutions are the foundation for many business enterprises, and the BSCS allows MBA students to understand how these systems work at the very basic level to the highest management level.
            

        Entrepreneurial ventures depend upon software, problem solving, and a strong sense of business success talents.
