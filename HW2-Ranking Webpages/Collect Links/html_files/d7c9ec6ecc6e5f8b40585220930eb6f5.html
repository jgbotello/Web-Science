                  Summer Financial Aid
              



Summer Financial Aid












            The Process
          


Summer aid is generally limited to loans, and in some cases, Federal Pell Grant eligibility. Not all students will qualify. For example, students who have already borrowed their maximum loan eligibility for the academic year or students who will be enrolled less than half-time are ineligible.
Students interested in summer aid:

Deadline to submit Summer Aid Request Form is June 30, 2024.
Your 2023-2024 FAFSA must be on file with the Office of Student Financial Aid.
You are responsible for notifying financial aid if your enrollment level changes.
Parents will need to submit a Parent PLUS Data Form (along with the Summer Aid Request Form) if requesting a Parent PLUS Loan.
Complete a Summer Aid Adjustment Form to submit any changes to your summer aid or enrollment no later than the last day of summer classes.

Online Learners

If you are taking classes at ODU only, submit the Summer Aid Request Form.
If you are enrolled at ODU and an approved Virginia Community College, see your academic advisor to obtain and complete both the Enrollment Form and Consortium Agreement Form.
If you are taking classes at ODU and Tidewater Community College (TCC) or Thomas Nelson Community College (TNCC), contact Registrar's Office for information regarding cross-registration.











            The Application
      














How to Apply






Complete the 2023-2024 FAFSA Application online. If you have already completed a 2023-2024 FAFSA, you do not need to complete a new one.
Submit the summer aid request form online to the financial aid office.

Once your eligibility has been evaluated, you will receive an offer notice via email to your ODU student email address.
Note: If you change your summer enrollment, you must immediately report your hours to the financial aid office. Any change in enrollment could affect aid eligibility.







Eligibility Requirements






You must be admitted to a degree seeking program.
You must be making Satisfactory Academic Progress.
You cannot be in default on a student loan or owe a repayment to a Federal Grant.
Receipt of additional financial assistance from any source could affect Federal Aid eligibility. Failure to report other sources of aid may result in required repayment of Federal Aid funds.
Summer aid is contingent on funding availability and is not guaranteed.








Federal Pell Grant






Eligible students may be awarded up to 150 percent of the student's scheduled award during a single award year.
If you received Pell Grant as a full-time student fall and spring, you could still receive Pell Grant for the 2024 summer semester if you are enrolled at least half-time (6) degree-applicable credit hours.
If you received a less than full time Pell Grant award in the fall and spring due to part-time enrollment, you may be entitled to a pro-rated summer Pell grant award even if enrolled less than half-time.
Pell Grant can only be awarded if you have not met the Pell Grant Lifetime Eligibility Used (LEU) amount. Information on Pell Grant (LEU) is available at https://studentaid.gov/.








Federal Loans





You must be enrolled in at least half-time (6 hours for Undergraduate students / 3 hours for Graduate Students) to be eligible for a student loan. Auditing a class does not count toward satisfying enrollment requirements.

The Office of Financial Aid will evaluate eligibility for student loans.
Loans received in previous semesters for the 2023-2024 academic year will affect Summer 2024 loan eligibility.
Students who have already received the maximum loan amount(s) for the 2023-2024 academic year will not be eligible for summer loans. If a student has progressed a grade level (i.e. Sophomore to Junior) additional funds may be available and eligibility will be evaluated.
Students who have reached the aggregate (lifetime) loan limits for their level are not eligible for additional loan funds.
The Office of Financial Aid will evaluate eligibility for student loans.

Other funding may be available through a PLUS loan or through a private loan, if the student is enrolled at least half-time. This funding may be used (1) to supplement the award that is made in response to this application or (2) to serve as a sole source of funding. If the PLUS is denied, the dependent student may be offered additional unsubsidized federal loan.
PLUS loans are available (1) to parents of dependent, undergraduate students and (2) to graduate or professional-degree students. To apply for a PLUS Loan, first complete the direct PLUS loan application online at https://studentaid.gov/. Completing this application will initiate a credit check. Second, applicants must submit a datasheet to our Office. The datasheet for parents is available online at Parent Plus Loan Datasheet. The datasheet for graduate or professional students is available online at Graduate PLUS Loan Datasheet.
For information about private loans, visit our website or contact us at (757) 683-3683.
Important: Federal regulations limit the Stafford loan amount a student may borrow during the academic year. Summer 2024 ends the 2023-2024 academic year.







Things to Know






Summer aid will not be disbursed until the number of credits for which the student has enrolled matches the number of credits listed on the summer aid application. Therefore, students must notify their counselors of changes in enrollment status.
The last day to request aid eligibility review for Summer 2024 is June 30, 2024. Please allow 2 weeks for processing/review upon submission. Requests are processed in the date order received.
Although students will be notified of tentative summer eligibility via email. Applicants are strongly encouraged to view their financial aid information via LEOonline.
The award you will receive is tentative. It is based on what you report as your anticipated enrollment. Enrolling in fewer credit hours than anticipated may result in a reduction or cancellation of aid.
Do not assume you are receiving financial aid until you have received an aid offer AND you have submitted/completed all documents needed to process your aid. The summer aid offer acceptance must be returned to the financial aid office before the summer aid can be disbursed.
Students will be notified via email if ineligible for summer aid.








Summer Disbursement of Funds






Summer aid will be disbursed in the Summer Session where the student begins attendance. (i.e., If the student has 3 hours during the Summer 1 Session and 3 hours for the Summer 2 Session, the Pell Grant will be disbursed to the Student's account during the Summer 1 Session. NOTE: In this example, dropping the Summer 2 Session course before it begins would result in the student owing back money.)
IMPORTANT NOTE: Dropping courses may result in the student owing back money. Any change in enrollment should be reported to Office of Financial Aid.
