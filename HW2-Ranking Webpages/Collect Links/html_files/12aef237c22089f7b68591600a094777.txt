About this Program

The doctoral program in computational and applied mathematics offered by the Department of Mathematics and Statistics is designed to produce applied mathematicians and statisticians who can meet the growing demand for analytical and computational skills in traditional scientific and multi-disciplinary fields. Students in the program can choose to pursue an option in either applied mathematics, statistics, or biostatistics.




Program Highlights


ODU is one of the few institutions around the world that offers a Computational and Applied Mathematics graduate program, rather than a traditional mathematics program.


Coursework for the Ph.D. degree contains a significant component in Big Data Analytics


Distinguished by its connections to Modeling and Simulation research throughout the campus

Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Computational & Applied Mathematics at ODU?
Students entering the Doctor of Philosophy program in Computational & Applied Mathematics should meet the minimum university admission requirements Graduate Admission.


The Ph.D. requires 57 credit hours of course work beyond the bachelor’s degree (24 credit hours beyond the master’s degree) selected to fulfill an option in applied mathematics, statistics or biostatistics. At the end of the course work the student must pass a Ph.D. Candidacy Examination. A doctoral dissertation representing an achievement in research and a significant contribution to the field is required. Students must take a minimum of 24 hours of such research credit. A public defense of the dissertation is the final requirement.
