Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Mechanical Engineering Technology at ODU?
Students entering the Bachelor of Science in Engineering Technology program in Mechanical Engineering Technology should meet the minimum university admission requirements Undergraduate Admission.


Students who qualify for regular admission to the University will be accepted into EFD (Engineering Fundamentals Division). Students in EFD may identify a desired degree program or may declare that they are undecided among engineering and engineering technology programs. They will be assigned an intended major code classification, which indicates that they are enrolled and, if appropriate, which is their preferred program. Students can apply to the MET program during the semester in which they complete the following requirements in the Engineering Fundamentals Division:




Complete ENGN 110 - Explore Engineering and Technology 


Complete at least 30 credit hours applicable toward the degree.  This is typically after the freshman year of courses


Have an overall GPA of 2.00 or higher
