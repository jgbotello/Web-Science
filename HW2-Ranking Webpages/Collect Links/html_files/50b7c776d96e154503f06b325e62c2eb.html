New to Blue: New Student Experience


















Welcome to the Monarch community! Your New to Blue: New Student Experience includes three unique phases throughout the summer that will outline your required orientation activities, provide you with an online orientation course, and prepare you to visit campus this summer.










 








            Make Me a Monarch
      


Make Me a Monarch kicks off your new student experience at Old Dominion University. Following Admitted Students Day, we will have a weekly Q&A via Zoom to answer all your new student questions.
