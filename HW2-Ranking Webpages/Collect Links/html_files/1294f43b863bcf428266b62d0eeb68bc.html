About this Program

The Coastal Engineering Certificate Program provides practicing engineers the opportunity to study coastal engineering at the graduate level. The certificate demonstrates a basic level of understanding of the physical sciences, engineering, economics, environmental, institutional-political-social, and aesthetic constraints that influence all coastal engineering design. The certificate may also provide the necessary credentials for continuing education by state licensing boards and professional organizations. The certificate requires four graduate level courses in the specialty area of Coastal Engineering within Civil Engineering.




Program Highlights


Internships in areas related to the program are available. 


Students are encouraged to assist with faculty research projects and to present their own research at regional, national and international professional communication associations. 


Opportunities to develop study abroad programs are available.


The Certificate can be completed in 2 years, and all courses are relatively self-contained so that you can begin at any semester
