About this Program

A degree in physics, with research concentration, is designed primarily for students preparing to do graduate study in physics and related fields or for students preparing to work professionally upon completion of the B. S. degree in various technical fields requiring the strongest preparation in physics.




Program Highlights


Selected by the University to achieve national prominence, taking advantage of Old Dominion’s proximity (a half-hour drive) to the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), the world’s premier nuclear physics research facility, and the NASA Langley Research Center


The Physics department has grown tremendously in the past 20 years, with double the number of faculty, new teaching and laboratory facilities and modernized computer-based undergraduate laboratories


The addition of the new Physical Sciences Research Building offers substantial opportunities for research to graduate and undergraduate students alike
