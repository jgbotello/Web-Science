                            The EPPE program has provided me with numerous opportunities to expand my research skills and knowledge while working with faculty on grants, research projects, and publications. I am so grateful for the EPPE faculty; their support is unmeasurable.

                            Thank you to each of my professors for making my time in the program an amazing experience! A special thank you to Dr. Burns for leading the Puerto Rico internship, an experience I will treasure forever. [Library Studies]

            Innovative Faculty 
          




Dr. Kevin Mallary
Dr. Xinyue Ren
Dr. Helen Crompton








 

Dr. Mallary’s scholarship explores how disabled students engage with information in academic libraries and higher education, and how library and information science educators design accessible instruction to include disabled students. He regularly publishes his findings in academic journals and international conference proceedings.






 

Dr. Xinyue Ren graduated with a Ph.D. degree in Instructional Technology from Ohio University in 2020. She also earned her master’s degrees in Educational Research and Evaluation as well as Critical Studies in Education from Ohio University. For the past three years, she worked as an instructional designer in higher education, in which she collaborated with faculty designing and developing online courses, provided faculty professional development workshops, and worked on some projects, such as open educational resources (OERs) and Quality Matters (QM). She also had experience working as an instructional designer at non-profit organizations and software company. Her research interests focus on the use of learning technologies and instructional design practices to achieve culturally inclusive online learning environments to promote educational equity.






 

Dr. Helen Crompton is a Professor of Instructional Technology in STEMPS and the Executive Director of the Research Institute for Digital Innovation in Learning at ODUGlobal. Dr. Crompton examines the use of technology in education from K-12 to adult education. Dr. Crompton’s training is in elementary education, and she taught elementary students for 16 years. Based on her classroom experiences, her expertise extends beyond academia to practice. She frequently serves as a consultant for various governments, bilateral and multilateral organizations such as the United Nations, leveraging her knowledge and experience to drive meaningful change in the field of educational technology.
