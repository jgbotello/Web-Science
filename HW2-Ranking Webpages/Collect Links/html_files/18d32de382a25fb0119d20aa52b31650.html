Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Aerospace Engineering at ODU?
Students entering the Master of Engineering program in Aerospace Engineering should meet the minimum university admission requirements Graduate Admission.


The applicant must have earned an undergraduate degree from an accredited university in aerospace engineering, mechanical engineering, engineering mechanics, or a closely related discipline, such as physics or mathematics, and must also meet Old Dominion University’s general requirements for admission. Applicants with degrees in disciplines other than aerospace engineering or mechanical engineering are required to complete up to three leveling courses. A remedial study plan will be designed for the applicant by the GPD in order to prepare the student for graduate work in the shortest possible time. The selected courses are subject to satisfying the prerequisites listed in the catalog. If an applicant already has a minor in aerospace engineering or mechanical engineering, then no leveling courses are necessary.
