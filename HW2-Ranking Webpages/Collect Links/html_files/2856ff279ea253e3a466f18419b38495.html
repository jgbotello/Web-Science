Key Features
Electronic mail system for students (admitted prior to February 1, 2023) powered by Google.
Overview
The Old Dominion University email system is the official electronic mail system for receiving course-related communications, policies, announcements and other information.
Available To:
Students admitted to ODU prior to February 1, 2023.
(As of February 1, 2023, new student email accounts are provided through Microsoft Office365.)
Usage Requirements
When you are admitted as a new student and create a MIDAS account, your student email account is automatically activated. This email is yours for as long as you remain a student and is deleted one year after your last class at ODU, whether you graduate, transfer or decide not to register for additional classes.
Getting Started
Students must first activate their MIDAS account at midas.odu.edu. The email account is activated as part of this process. To access student email, log in with your MIDAS ID and password.



GMAIL
If your student email account is provided by Google (if you were admitted before February 1, 2023), access your account in one of the following ways:




ONLINE
Go to mail.google.com/a/odu.edu and log in with your MIDAS ID and password.









myODU PORTAL
Access your email (plus news, announcements, University services and more) at my.odu.edu.









MOBILE EMAIL APPS
Add your student email as a Google account to any of these supported apps: Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail






For help with your ODU Gmail account, see the Gmail Support page.
Gmail tips
Because student email is a Google product, you can take advantage of Gmail features:
Use labels in Gmail as a way to categorize or tag items and make them more searchable. More: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/118708
For most messages in Gmail, archiving is preferable to deleting. You should delete mail that you really and truly don't need, but if there's ever a doubt in your mind, just archive it. More: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6576
Use Search in Gmail the same way you use Google to search the web by typing in keywords to find messages in your account. More: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6593
Use filters to automatically sort and apply labels to mail. More: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579
Use stars to mark special messages or as a visual reminder for ones needing follow up on or to provide an easy way to spot certain items in your inbox. More: https://support.google.com/mail/answer/5904
Keyboard shortcuts are available for Gmail to help you save time and navigate your inbox. Suggested shortcuts are available at https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594
Unsubscribe from anything that is causing clutter in your inbox. This will allow you to focus on the more important messages. If you do want to receive ads or other subscription information in your Gmail account, use filters to send them directly to another folder. This will keep your inbox clean.
Use Gmail's built-in feature to help identify legitimate emails from the top company's whose messages are spoofed. Go to "Settings", then "Labs," and find "Authentication icon for verified senders." Enable it. Whenever you get an email from a company like Ebay or PayPal, you'll see a little key next to their name if the message is legitimate.
Use Google Help pages for assistance with common issues. https://support.google.com/mail/
