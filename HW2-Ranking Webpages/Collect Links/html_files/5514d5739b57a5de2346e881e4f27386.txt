About this Program

An undergraduate Minor degree in Environmental Engineering can be obtained by Civil Engineering major students or students from outside the Civil and Environmental Engineering department. Various Environmental Engineering courses are available in Environmental Engineering minor program that allow pursuit of several areas of study or specialization within Environmental Engineering -- water quality, water and wastewater treatment, hazardous wastes, air quality, sustainable development, and energy engineering.




Program Highlights


Civil & Environmental Engineering are highly interconnected in terms of analysis, design, implementation, and management activities, which is why the combined Civil Engineering major + Environmental Engineering minor degree is the most highly sought-after qualification by employers.


With additional graduate level Environmental Engineering coursework, one can pursue a career as an Environmental Engineer.
