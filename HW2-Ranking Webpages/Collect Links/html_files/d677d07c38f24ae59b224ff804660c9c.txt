SEES Communications








            Mission
      


SEES Communications offers multi-functional and interconnected resources in strategic communications, creative services, brand alignment, and visual communications for the Division of Student Engagement & Enrollment Services.











            Services
          




Strategic Communication
Copy-Editing
Graphic Design
Video & Photography








We support the development of communication plans that identify effective channels and foster division dialogue, which describes what you want to accomplish with your unit.






Even excellent writers who are meticulous with grammar, spelling, and punctuation will miss the small details that elevate text from good to great. It's easy to overlook technical elements, such as inconsistent use of commas or the overuse of a certain word. Everyone needs an editor, no matter how thoroughly they read and proofread their writing.
We use the Associated Press Stylebook guidelines when editing and provide this service at no cost for all Division publications.






We focus on projects that require a combination of original design, writing, photography, and printing. We can consult on projects that ultimately promote the Division and University, both to the public and on campus. Click here to see our publications!
