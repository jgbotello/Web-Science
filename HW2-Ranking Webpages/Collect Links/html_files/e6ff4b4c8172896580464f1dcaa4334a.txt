Be a hero in your own life. Teach.
The Department of Teaching and Learning aims to promote the development of our students as professional educators, leaders, and critically engaged citizens. Through these efforts, our students become innovative and creative educators who make a difference for diverse learners, from birth through adulthood, in schools and communities, both local and global.
To fulfill this mission, the department offers research-based programs, including initial licensure programs for those entering the teaching profession, and advanced programs, both masters and doctoral degrees, for practicing educators who wish to further develop their expertise.
