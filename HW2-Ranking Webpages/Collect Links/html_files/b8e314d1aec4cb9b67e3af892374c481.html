About this Program

In keeping with the Art Department's mission of empowering students to become visually critical thinkers through their creative practice, the 3D Media and Material Studies major focuses on making as a form of thinking through technical mastery of both traditional craftsmanship and emerging technologies. Students are also exposed to the expanding range of working three-dimensional studio practice, including performance and installation and time-based art. Through immersion in a research and process-oriented curriculum, students develop a range of transferable skills and a body of work reflecting artistic maturity, material proficiency, and conceptual development.




Program Highlights


Students are exposed to the expanding scope of three-dimensional studio practice including performance, installation, and time-based art.


The 3D Media & Material Studies classrooms are housed in brand new facilities in the Barry Arts Building, the Hixon Studio Building and Annex and provide students the equipment necessary to produce their work comfortably and safely.


Small class sizes mean students have access to instructors who know students by name, understand each student's individualized goals, and who create their own work under the same roof.
