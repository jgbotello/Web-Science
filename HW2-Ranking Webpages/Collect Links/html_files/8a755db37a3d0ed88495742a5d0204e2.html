Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Mechanical Engineering at ODU?
Students entering the Doctor of Philosophy program in Mechanical Engineering should meet the minimum university admission requirements Graduate Admission.


To qualify for admission to a Doctor of Philosophy degree in Mechanical Engineering, a student must have earned a master’s degree from an accredited institution of higher learning in engineering, physics, or mathematics, including graduate-level course work equivalent to the corresponding master’s programs in Mechanical Engineering. Applicants with an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.5 on a 4.0 scale at the master’s level are eligible for regular admission. Applicants with a GPA below 3.5 who present evidence and potential for improvement may be eligible for provisional admission. Students are typically required to submit their Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores, although the Graduate Program Director (GPD) may waive the GRE requirement for applicants with excellent academic credentials.
