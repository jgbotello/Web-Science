About this Program

Building upon a foundation of programming skills and knowledge, the minor in Web Programming prepares students to take aspects of their major field of study to the Internet. Students will learn how to do much more than develop and publish a simple static webpage of plain text. Students will explore the techniques of dynamically rendering pages that communicate information, collecting and displaying data, and processing results on a server. Emerging technologies are utilized and instruction is provided by our Web Science scholars.
