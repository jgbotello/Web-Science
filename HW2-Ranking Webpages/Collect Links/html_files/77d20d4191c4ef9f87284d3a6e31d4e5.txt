What is the Center for Major Exploration & Mane Connect Success Coaching?
The Center for Major Exploration (CME) assists students to choose a major and explore potential careers. Academic advisors collaborate with students to identify interests, skills, and abilities that translate into a major that best fits the individual student.

Top 13 Resources for Success














What's Success Coaching?





Coaches work one-on-one with first-year students to teach skills to help students maximize their college experience both inside and outside the classroom. Through regular meetings, students will establish goals and develop objectives to reach goals with their coach. Coaches will also promote the utilization of campus support services and student engagement on campus.







How Was I Selected?





First-year students are selected based on eligibility criteria.







How Long Are Coaching Sessions?





Individual sessions generally range from 20-30 minutes.







How Often Will I Meet With My Coach?





Students are required to meet with their coach regularly. Coaches work with students on determining how often that is based on student need. Every two weeks is a general rule.







Is this program mandatory?





While the program is not mandatory, Success Coaches seek to help students in all aspects of college success.







I told my roommate about this program, and now he/she wants a success coach. How can my roommate be a part of Mane Connect?





At this time, coaching is limited to pre-selected students. However, students requesting additional support are encouraged to contact the Mane Connect coaching office for an appropriate referral.







How did I get matched to my coach?





Students are assigned coaches at random.







What will my coach and I talk about?





Coaching meetings are individualized and vary based on student needs and personal goals.







Will my parents be informed of what I discuss during my coaching sessions?





No. Due to FERPA regulations, coaches are not permitted to share information discussed in coaching sessions with parents. If you want your parents to be invovlved, contact your coach.







Who are the coaches?





Check out our coaches by clicking here.







How do I schedule n appointment with my coach?





You can call the Mane Connect office at 757-683-4805 or email your coach directly. Appointments can also be made using your coach's availability link.







How do I know if I will get an advisor and a success coach?





First-year students who are undecided in their major will work with an academic advisor/success coach. Upperclassmen who are undecided will work only with an academic advisor.







What happens if I don't make my coaching appointment or need to reschedule?





The coaching office requires at least 24 hours notice to cancel or reschedule appointments. This helps to ensure your peers can have access to vacant time slots and coach calendars are accurate.
