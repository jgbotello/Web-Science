About this Program

 The undergraduate program in accounting at Old Dominion University is one of a select group in the country with separate accreditation from AACSB-International. The program provides a broad-based education with a variety of career objectives. The Accounting General concentration (AG) provides students with technical accounting knowledge and the ability to analyze problems, communicate solutions, interact with colleagues, and successfully handle ethical issues appropriate for staff-level positions.

The program attracts students transitioning from the military, all races, foreign undergraduates from a variety of countries, about an equal number of men and women, as well as both older and traditionally aged college students. We also do a booming business in second degree seekers. And, believe it or not, the faculty are very helpful whether it is questions about classes, school, interviews, jobs, or personal concern.
