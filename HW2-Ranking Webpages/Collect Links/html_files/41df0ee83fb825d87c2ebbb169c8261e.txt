Undergraduate Advising













Students are our top priority
We actively provide students with a supportive environment, offer timely and dependable guidance, and educate students about campus policies and academic programs.
We partner with faculty advisors, academic departments, and other support staff to encourage all students' academic and personal development.
Not sure where to start? Meet with your advisor one-on-one to discuss your options and identify programs that will meet your needs.
Advising basics

All freshman students admitted to the first-year program are advised by a professional advisor.  For questions, please email engineeringadvising@odu.edu to be connected with your advisor.
All transfer students are advised by Anna Lacy.
Departmental advising takes place when students are in MATH 212 and PHYS 231N by your major's department.
