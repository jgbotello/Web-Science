There is a wide range in quality of educational videos that learners navigate. A range in quality of content, production, and relevance. Whether you’re a student watching lecture videos for class, watching videos as a supplement to your regular coursework, or a life-long learner who simply wants to learn more about the world (and tuberculosis), I want to talk about two strategies that can help you learn more from videos.

Megan Sumeracki 
For Teachers, For Researchers, Learning Scientists Posts
In my last blog, I covered a paper I published (1) about questions in class, covert retrieval, and cold calling.
