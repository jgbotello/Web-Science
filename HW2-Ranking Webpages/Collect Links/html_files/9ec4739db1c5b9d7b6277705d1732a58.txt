Impact Learning Communities
















What are Impact Learning Communities?
Impact Learning Communities (ILCs) aid undergraduate students in the transition to college by allowing them to create an instant community with their peers. The ILC experience offers the opportunity for students with similar interests to learn together. In addition to smaller class sizes, students build deeper connections with faculty, participate in enrichment activities, and are supported by a peer mentor. ILCs are open to undergraduate students living on or off campus.
