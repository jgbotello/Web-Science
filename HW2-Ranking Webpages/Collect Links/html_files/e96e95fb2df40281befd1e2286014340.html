About this Program

The graduate certificate in Social Justice & Entrepreneurship focuses on students cultivating tools that are essential to launching and sustaining successful activist, community organizing, non-profit, social entrepreneurial, and social justice-based programs/initiatives. These tools include action plan development and implementation, fundraising and grant writing, social media and on-the-ground mobilization and engagement, community-driven problem solving, attracting and engaging media and stakeholders, organizational communication strategies and developing sustainable and responsive programs by identifying and assessing opportunities and resources. These skills are paired with critical tools drawn from studying the history, ethics and principles of social justice activities.  




Program Highlights


The program focuses on generating entrepreneurial solutions that solve seemingly intractable problems of social justice. In particular, students are encouraged to address problems of community equity as they address numerous issues ranging from arts to housing and in between.
