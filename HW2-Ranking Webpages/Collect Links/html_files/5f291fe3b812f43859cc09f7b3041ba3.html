Frequently Asked Questions




Can you get a degree in computer science online?




Of course. Earning a computer science degree online isn't all that different than pursuing the same program on a campus. At SNHU, there are weekly assignments, as well as regular interactions with your classmates and instructor.
But participating in an online program can have some benefits over a campus program. When you earn your online computer science degree at SNHU, you can do your classwork when you want. That's because there are no set class times – only weekly deadlines that are set at the beginning of the term. You get to do your assignments when it's most convenient for you, whether that's in the morning before work, on your lunch break or after you put the kids to bed.
It makes sense to earn your bachelor's in computer science online, because your desktop or laptop device is exactly what you'd be doing your assignments on no matter where your classes are. Plus, SNHU gives you access to our virtual environment, which gets you into the software applications, simulations and virtual desktops you need for classes – the same applications you'll use in the workforce. 





What is the best online college for computer science?




The best place for you to earn your computer science degree online may not be the right place for others to get their degree. You'll need to consider the factors that are the most important to you so that you can reach the finish line.
When you speak with a member of our admission team, you can get the answers you need to decide if SNHU is the school with the online computer science degree for you.
Some of your questions may revolve around:

Curriculum. Review course requirements and electives to make sure the material you'll cover throughout the program are what you need to get you to your goals. Between your general education courses and your degree-specific classes, SNHU helps you position yourself for success beyond the computer science skills you learn in the classroom.
Concentrations. SNHU offers 4 concentrations for its bachelor of computer science program: data analysis, information security, project management and software engineering. A specialized bachelor's degree can give you an edge in the workforce.
Experiential learning opportunities. Hands-on experience can not only help prepare you and give you confidence for your career, but it can also help add depth to your resume, helping you move to the top of the pile. You'll get opportunities in many of our cloud-based virtual environments, which give you access to the technology you need for your degree – and your career. You'll also want to consider speaking with one of our career advisors, who can help put you in touch with an employer for a project or an internship.

So why do our students choose SNHU? Other reasons include low online tuition rates, flexibility of online programs, career-focused degree programs and a support system that's dedicated to your success. 





Are computer scientists in demand?




Yes. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that jobs in software development are projected to grow 25% through 2032 – much faster than the average of all occupations.1
Most of the jobs in the field—like software developers or quality assurance analysts—normally require at least a bachelor's degree to break into the field.
However, it's not just about your tech skills. “Employers like to see if you bring experience they can use," said Curtis George, technical program facilitator at SNHU. "The biggest soft skills in demand ... are collaboration and communication.” Your ability to work well with a team makes this career more than just code.
Another attractive part of jobs in computer and information technology? The salary. The median annual wage in 2022 for these occupations was $100,530 – more than $38,000 higher than the median annual wage for all occupations.1

What is the difference between computer science and information technology (IT)?




These two career paths may sound like they are similar, but in reality, they only have a slight overlap in skill sets and responsibilities.
In a computer science degree program, you study and develop computers, networks, hardware, software and databases. It involves engineering, math and science – topics you'll rely on regularly in a computer science role – and a bachelor's degree in computer science is broad enough to give you plenty of career options.
Information technology (IT) is the use of technology to store, retrieve and send information, usually in a business setting. Professionals in IT careers are often the decision-makers regarding technology in an organization.
"Everything that you touch, everything that you wear, everything that you interact with, anything that you order online, it's all IT," said Ben Steinbach, a Career Advisor at SNHU.
At SNHU, majoring in computer science means your courses focus on subjects like computer programming, software development, security and data structures. The IT curriculum exposes you to scripting, operating systems, networks and systems requirements.
Both degree programs open doors to careers with projected growth. It's up to you to decide with technology path you're interested in taking.
Many students may choose to major in computer science as undergrads and then continue their education at the graduate level with an online master's in IT, which features 7 career-focused concentrations such as web design and software application development. 





How long does it take to get a computer science degree?




The amount of time it takes to earn your online computer science degree can vary – on you, your educational background and your goals.
If you've previously attended other institutions, it can shorten your time at SNHU by transferring those credits into your program here. SNHU offers students a generous transfer policy, accepting up to 90 credits toward your degree.
Discuss your free transfer credit evaluation with your admission counselor. This allows you to see where all your previously earned credits can go toward your program – and it allows you to find out what classes you have left to take before you can graduate with your BS in Computer Science.
Our admission team can walk you through your evaluation to show you where your transfer credits are placed in your evaluation and how well they fit into your chosen program. For example, if you've already taken your general education courses – as well as a number of computer science credits – you could position yourself to finish your degree faster.
In addition, you'll want to decide if you want to take classes full time or part time. With SNHU's 8-week terms, enrolling in 1 class is considered part time and 2 classes is full time. If you work and have other obligations that can limit the amount of time you have available to work toward your bachelor's in computer science, you'll want to take that into consideration to determine what you can successfully accomplish each term.
Your academic advisor is always available to help you create a custom course plan so that you know exactly when you'll reach the finish line.
Danielle Hoopes, a 2018 computer science alumna, appreciated how her academic advisor helped her graduate.
"His check-ins kept me on track and having someone to go to with any questions was something I had never had before," Hoopes said. "I just kept telling myself that my dream of becoming a leader in technology was attainable and the staff at SNHU helped me accomplish it." 





How much is a bachelor's degree in computer science?




At SNHU, it all comes down to where you're at in your educational journey.
If you begin at SNHU with no credits, and at the current rate of $330 a credit, you'd pay $39,600 in tuition – for your entire bachelor's degree. (That's oftentimes the same amount it can cost for a single year of tuition at many traditional brick-and-mortar colleges.)
However, most online students at SNHU enroll with transfer credits. So if you've already invested in your education at other institutions previously, and you are able to transfer in credits, the amount your program costs can drop significantly. SNHU accepts up to 90 transfer credits toward your bachelor's – meaning you could pay as little as $9,900 in tuition to complete your online computer science degree.
You can also keep your costs low at SNHU by working with our Student Financial Services team. They'll walk you through the process of filling out the FAFSA form, which can determine your eligibility for grants and repayable loans. Our SFS counselors will also help you customize a plan to maximize your awards and make your degree as affordable as possible. 





What’s the difference between a software developer and a software engineer?




Both software developers and software engineers share many aspects in their career. A professional in either role may help develop or manage the software a business uses. However, a software developer may spend more time creating and troubleshooting new programs, while a software engineer may continue managing, maintaining and improving existing software.
Still, both terms have been used interchangeably and with a heavy overlap in skills, businesses may not even separate the roles.

"Software development focuses on the programming aspect of developing software, whereas software engineering also includes the engineering discipline that provides the structure for designing the applications," said Dr. Francis J. Manning III, adjunct faculty and academic partner at Southern New Hampshire University. "This is an important distinction because all software engineers may also be software developers, while the opposite is not always or even often the case."
Either title requires strong interpersonal skills because the jobs don't just involve the code – they involve working with the people who use the software. The field is multi-faceted.
