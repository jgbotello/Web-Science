About this Program

The minor in military leadership is a high quality, interdisciplinary, multidimensional, experiential, and culturally diverse program that exposes students to, and prepares them for, real life leadership opportunities and challenges. A foundation of naval science is established including naval history, shipboard navigation, naval operations, ship systems, evolution of warfare, and manuevering warfare. Students explore issues of leadership, citizenship, and social change within the context of an inquiry, experiential, and competency-based instructional design.




Program Highlights


Educational: comprehensive review of any and all topics related to the United States Navy and Marine Corps including technical expertise, seamanship, and exemplary warfare capabilities


Enthusiasm: each course is taught by an Active Duty Naval or Marine Corps Officer that has a plethora of experience and knowledge acquired throughout their careers


Applicability: classroom knowledge directly translates to the fundamental skills required of Naval and Marine Corps junior officers to maintain, utilize, and fight the most technologically advanced machinery in the world


COVE: The Conning Officer Virtual Environment (COVE) provides state-of-the-art navigation and shiphandling training and can emulate the U.S. Navy’s homeports and almost every routine port of call around the world
