About this Program

The master’s degree program is appropriate for individuals wishing to gain additional research experience prior to enrolling in a psychology doctoral program at Old Dominion University or another university or for those individuals who are seeking the master’s as a terminal degree. The curriculum is designed to provide a strong background in statistics, research methods, and general psychology so that the student will have a wide range of choices for future professional education and development. The program requires a major research project that culminates in the master’s thesis, the focus of which is determined and supervised through one-on-one mentoring with a faculty member with whom the student works throughout their time in the program. Although the master’s degree is not a licensing or practicing degree, it prepares students to be competent researchers, consumers, and interpreters of psychological science.




Program Highlights


Students work closely with members of the faculty to participate in the research and other professional activities that are available within the department


Students work closely with mentors who guide the student’s research focus, study design, data collection, and interpretation

Students frequently present their research at national and international conferences and publish in professional journals
