    The Neuro-Information Retrieval and Data Science (NIRDS) Lab at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, is a research group
    with focus on neuro-information retrieval, human computer interaction, data science, and machine learning. Nero-information retrieval is a novel area of IR research that apply cognitive psychology
    and neuro-physiological methods (eye tracking, EEG, EOG, and wearables) to understand information searchers and improve search experience. Neuro-IR is useful in investigating the search as a
    learning process and to employ these sensory data as assessment of reading, mind-wandering and in inferring learning disabilities.
    Our research group comprise of 4 PhD students, 1 MS student, and 2 undergraduate students.
