Disney









	The “Tiana” animated series in the works at Disney+ has enlisted Joyce Sherri as the show’s lead writer and director, Variety has learned exclusively. 

	The musical project was originally announced in 2020 during a Disney investor day. The series has previously been described as a followup to the 2009 animated film “The Princess and the Frog,” which introduced the character of Tiana. Anika Noni Rose will once again provide the voice of Tiana. The series was originally expected to debut in 2023 but is now said to be launching in 2024. 

	Sherri’s most recent TV writing credit was on the Netflix horror miniseries “Midnight Mass” from Mike Flanagan. She has also written and directed short films like “Beauty,” “Forever,” “Down, Down, Baby” and “The Family Romance.” She also won the 2020 Slamdance screenplay competition for her feature, “Sweet Sixteen,” and was selected for the 2021 Sundance Institute Screenwriters Intensive.

	She is repped by Gersh, Untitled, and Del Shaw Moonves. 

	The official description for “Tiana” states that the show will follow the title character as she “sets off for a grand new adventure as the newly crowned Princess of Maldonia, but a calling to her New Orleans past isn’t far behind.”

	Walt Disney Animation Studios will produce “Tiana,” as the studio previously made “The Princess and the Frog.” Nathan Curtis will produce, with Jennifer Lee and Stella Meghie executive producing. Meghie was previously attached as the writer and director of the series, but remains onboard as an EP. 

	Disney also previously announced Disney+ series followups to films like “Zootopia,” “Big Hero 6,” “Moana,” and “Cars.” At the time of this publishing, all of those have been released with the exception of “Moana,” though a live-action version of that film is currently in the works.
