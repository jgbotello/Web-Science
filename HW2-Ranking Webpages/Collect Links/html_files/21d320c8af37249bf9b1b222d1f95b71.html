About this Program

The electrical engineering program provides a solid foundation in networks, linear systems, electronics, electromagnetics, digital systems, and physical electronics. Emphasis is placed on understanding principles through theoretical investigation and experimental verification. Learn device fabrication processes (photolithography, oxidation, diffusion, metallization) and fabricate your own circuits in the clean room.




Program Highlights


Four tracks to choose from: Systems Science Track, Physical Electronics Track, Digital Design Track, & Electrical Power Track


ECE faculty support University centers such as the Applied Research Center, the Frank Reidy Center of Bioelectrics, and the Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center


Additional research facilities in the Hampton Roads area with ECE faculty collaboration include the National Institute of Aerospace, NASA Langley Research Center and Jefferson Lab


The ECE department has research laboratories focusing on Applied Plasma Technology; Cybersecurity, Communications and Networking Innovation; Microelectronics and Thin Film Devices; Medical Imaging, Diagnosis, and Analysis; Power Research; Systems Analysis of Metabolic Physiology; Systems Research; Virginia Institute for Photovoltaics; and Vision Lab
