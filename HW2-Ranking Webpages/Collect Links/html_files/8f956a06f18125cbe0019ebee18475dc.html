About this Program

The Painting and Drawing program supports the investigation of various methods, forms and histories of painting and drawing in addition to the spaces these modes occupy in the contemporary sphere. Students begin their studies with a thorough grounding in the skills required to successfully engage the traditions and contemporary practices of painting and drawing. Initial coursework provides students strong technical, perceptual and visualization skills through a comprehensive and rigorous Foundations and Studio Core curriculum; gaining material handling competencies of both painting and drawing media. Intermediate coursework includes a review and expansion of these competencies with exploration into the expressive potential of painting and drawing through thematically-driven projects. Advanced coursework provides students the tools to develop individual bodies of work exploring individualized preferred concepts, subject matter, techniques, and media.
