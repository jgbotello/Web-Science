Preparation + opportunity = success
That's the DSU equation. We're a four-year university with nationally recognized programs, cutting-edge facilities, and the brightest thinkers. But we're also a tight-knit, inclusive community. Small class sizes mean hands-on training and individualized attention. All this with an affordable, public school price that's among the best values in the region.

Is DSU the right fit for you? 
Even the best brochures and postcards (and yes, even websites) can only tell you so much about a college. The only surefire way to know if DSU is right for you is to see for yourself.

Step into the future of computer science
When it comes to computer science, we leave no line of code unfinished. Dakota State's Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program curriculum is dynamic, covering topics from programming language to data structures and algorithms to operating systems. You'll also analyze computer foundations from the beginning to the latest tools and applications.
With our focus on technology and your focus on academics, we'll make a great team. You'll have primal access to the data server room, the Information Assurance Lab, laptops, and 3D printers. Not to mention the latest software programs, like DSUnix, Linux, Irix, Solaris, or Windows.
DSU CYBER 27
Online or on-campus courses
The Computer Science bachelor’s program is offered 100% online or on campus. Whether you are a traditional student or a working professional, this flexible program allows you to complete your degree how it works best for you, remote, in-person, or hybrid, and as a full-time or part-time student.
Degree in three
Fast-track your education with the option to complete your bachelor’s in Computer Science in three years. Depending on the number of previously earned college-level credits and math test placements, the accelerated option can allow you to earn your degree even faster than the Degree in Three plan or traditional 4-year timeframe.
