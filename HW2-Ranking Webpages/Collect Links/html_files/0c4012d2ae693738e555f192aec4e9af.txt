About this Program

A minor in medical Technology requires a minimum of 12 semester hours of 300/400-level MLS courses. Students may choose courses from a specific laboratory science discipline (hematology, microbiology, clinical chemistry, and immunohematology) or from several disciplines. All prerequisite courses must be completed. Selection of a plan or program of study must be done in consultation with the program director. Note that completion of the minor does not allow eligibility for the national certification exam as Medical Laboratory Scientist. Clinical Practicum courses are reserved for students accepted to the major




Program Highlights


Completion of the minor provides students with theoretical knowledge and student laboratory experience in areas of clinical microbiology, hematology, clinical chemistry or blood banking which provide excellent background for future nurses, physician assistants, pathology assistants or physicians.
