About this Program

The Graduate Certificate in Biomedical Engineering program offers students and professionals the opportunity to further their knowledge with advanced study in the growing area of biomedical engineering. The program is designed to provide well-rounded instruction in several key facets of biomedical engineering. Those who complete the program receive the Advanced Engineering Certificate in Biomedical Engineering from Old Dominion University and a letter of recognition from the Batten College of Engineering and Technology. Courses taken for the certificate program may later be applied to the Master's or Ph.D. degrees in Biomedical Engineering.




Program Highlights


This program allows you to take graduate courses in Biomedical Engineering without making a large commitment.


If you are later accepted into the ME, MS, or PhD program, the credits you earned in the Certificate program can be transferred to your graduate degree.
