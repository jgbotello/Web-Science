Master of Science
					Computer Science with a Concentration in Information & Communications Technology (MS)





Overview

Admission

Curriculum





Yaohang Li, Graduate Program Director - Admissions
Andrey Chernikov, Graduate Program Director – Master’s
ICT (Information and Communications Technology) is the infrastructure and components that enable contemporary business computing. This MS program in Computer Science offers a unique combination of computer science technical knowledge and business IT skills that prepares graduate students for success in the business world of the 21st century. The program emphasizes cutting-edge ICT skills, which can provide a basis for job entry, career development and flexibility amid the rapid changes in Information Technology.


Admission
Entrance Requirements
Students entering the Master of Science program in computer science should meet the minimum university graduate admission requirements (https://www.odu.edu/admission/graduate). In addition, an applicant must have a strong background in computer science. Students who do not have a sufficient background in computer science may enter the graduate program as provisional students and make up for their deficiencies by taking appropriate courses. Applicants are required to take the GRE general test. For the Information & Communications Technology concentration, the GMAT aptitude test may be used. Two letters of recommendation from faculty members of academic institutions are required in addition to all transcripts at the postsecondary level. For students whose native language is not English, either a TOEFL score of 550 (paper-based) and 79 (internet-based) or IELTS score of 6.5 is also required.


Curriculum Requirements
This concentration, offered jointly with the Department of Information Technology and Decision Sciences in the Strome College of Business, is appropriate for students with either a bachelor’s degree in business administration with a major in information systems and a computer science minor or with a bachelor’s degree in computer science with a business administration minor. 
All of these requirements must be satisfied in addition to the University requirements outlined under the University Requirements for Graduate Degrees & Certificates section of this Catalog.
Core Courses
There are no core courses required for the ICT concentration. 
Colloquium
Each student is required to take a one-credit CS 690 (Computer Science Colloquium) and attend at least 10 departmental colloquiums during their MS study.
Course Options
Two options are available for candidates for master’s degrees:

project option, and
course-only option.

A minimum of 34 credit hours is required. In addition, the candidate is required to complete an exit examination that requires a comprehensive written report and an oral examination.
Course Restrictions 
A maximum of four 500-level courses can be applied to the program.
At least two of the CS graduate courses (6 credits) must be taken at the 600-level or 700-level from courses other than CS 697, CS 791, and CS 796.
Since internship is not a degree requirement, the courses CS 667, CS 668, and CS 669 do not count towards MS course requirements.


No more than nine credits total of the following courses may be counted towards the degree: CS 697, CS 791, and CS 796.


Although 800-level courses are primarily meant for PhD students, these courses may count as 700-level courses for the purposes of MS credit requirements.
