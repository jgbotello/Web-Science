        SCOPE
    

Key Question: How to Scale Up Care for Older Adults Successfully? As the global population ages, so does the demand for effective, scalable, and sustainable care solutions for older adults, creating critical challenges in healthcare and societal support systems. The "Scale-IT-up 2025" workshop aims to explore and expand the role of digital health technologies in addressing these challenges, specifically focusing on the shortage and burden of caregivers. We also encourage discussion of digitally enabled care concepts such as at-home hospitalization or virtual wards, which innovate traditional care concepts. This workshop will serve as a platform for researchers, technologists, and practitioners to share insights, innovations, and strategies for integrating digital health solutions into care for older adults.We invite submissions that address the following themes:Development and implementation of digital health technologies (or other innovative technological solutions) tailored towards care for older adults (e.g., psychosocial support for caregivers, alleviating caregiver burden, supporting older adults, etc.).Digital health interventions facilitating health behavior change and habit formation.Digital health solutions for mitigating the demographic impact on the healthcare system.Scaling and Diffusion of Digital Health Solutions, including both the scaling of business models and regional diffusion.Design considerations of technology for older adults (e.g., value-sensitive design, ethics by design, etc.).Case studies on the effectiveness of digital interventions in care settings.Market analysis and industry engagement identify leading and emerging technology sector players in care for older adults. Transformative solutions moving traditional care into digitally enabled integrated care (e.g., at-home hospitalization). Objectives: This workshop will facilitate multidisciplinary dialogue to:Explore well-established market leaders and top-funded early-stage companies shaping the future of care services for older adults. Engage with findings from interviews and assessments of these companies, providing a comprehensive view of current innovations and trends in the market.Highlight and disseminate cutting-edge research and practical solutions in digital health for older adults.Identify and discuss innovation patterns and lessons learned from successful digital health implementations. Foster collaborations between academia, industry, and healthcare providers to accelerate the adoption of new technologies.Outcome: The workshop aims to contribute to developing scalable, effective, and human-centered care solutions that can be integrated into existing health systems. Participants will understand how digital health technologies can transform care for older adults and provide support for caregivers. 




        TOPICS OF INTEREST
    

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

How to make prevention successful?
How to make healthy longevity successful?
How to make healthy aging successful?
How to make elderly care successful?
How to cope with the economic burden of non-communicable diseases?
Which emerging business models in digital health are promising?
What needs to change in terms of regulations to make digital health successful?
What is the future role of a health insurance company?
Which digital health technologies (DHTs) are already used and reimbursed? In which fields? What are those offerings? How are these paid for? (self-paid, basic insurance, additional insurance, etc.)
Are you offering DHTs? Did you develop these DHTs yourself or are you partnering with startups or other companies?
Do you offer DHTs rather in the prevention or in the management of diseases?
For which diseases do you think we need DHTs most? Why? Where do you think DHTs will work best? (what kind of disease and persona)
What is your main goal of offering these DHTs? (new revenue streams, cost-efficiency, customer loyalty)
What is the importance of business ecosystems for these DHTs?
What kind of learnings did you generate so far? Are there DHTs that worked better than others? Why?
Could you already assess the effectiveness and/or efficiency of DHTs?
What kind of DHTs failed? What were the reasons?
How would you improve DHTs you are offering?
