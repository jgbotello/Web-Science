Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Civil & Environmental Engineering at ODU?
Students entering the Doctor of Philosophy program in Civil & Environmental Engineering should meet the minimum university admission requirements Graduate Admission.


A master’s degree or equivalent in engineering or a related field is required for admission to the Ph.D. program; however, exceptionally well qualified students can be directly admitted to the Ph.D. program directly without a master’s degree. Each applicant must submit an essay of 500 words or less describing personal and academic goals, professional objectives, preparation for graduate study, and how the chosen program will help the applicant achieve these goals and objectives. Two letters of recommendation are required. At least one of these must be submitted from former or current professors, and one could be from an employment supervisor. Regular admission to a Ph.D. program generally requires a GPA of 3.5 or higher on a 4.0 scale in the master’s program. Applicants with a lower GPA may be considered for regular or provisional admission on the basis of successful engineering work experience or other credentials demonstrating potential for success in the Ph.D. program. Submission of GRE scores is required except for applicants who hold an engineering degree from an ABET-accredited engineering program. TOEFL (or IELTS) scores are required for all applicants whose native language is not English, unless they have earned a bachelor’s or master’s degree from institutions in USA or countries where English is the primary language of the people.
