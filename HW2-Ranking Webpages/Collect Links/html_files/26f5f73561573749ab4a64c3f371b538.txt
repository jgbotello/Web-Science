About this Program

Management is a broad area of study within business. It covers topics from human resource management and strategic planning to leadership and innovation. Any organization, whether it is small start-up or a large Fortune 100 firm, for profit or non-profit, government or private, requires management. A management minor is suitable for students who want to complement their major with “soft skills.” Surveys of employers have frequently found they prefer to recruit graduates with leadership, communication, entrepreneurial, and strategic thinking skills.




Program Highlights


Occupations in the field of management have a projected above average growth rate between 7-12% over the next 10 year based on current employment trends


Most management classes are offered in both live and online formats to match student needs!


Management classes are taught by both research active professors and practitioners


Several management courses have application-based projects with local businesses in Hampton Roads


ODU’s Management Department sponsors ODU’s Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM) Student Chapter which has close ties to the Hampton Roads professional SHRM Chapter. The ODU SHRM Chapter hosts events focused on networking and professional development
