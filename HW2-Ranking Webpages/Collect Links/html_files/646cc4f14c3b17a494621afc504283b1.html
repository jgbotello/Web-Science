About this Program

The Applied Language Studies (APLS) concentration focuses on the scientific study of language, with an emphasis on using linguistics to address real-world problems. Through the APLS curriculum, students learn the basic structural features that comprise all languages. Students at ODU who choose the B.A. or Minor in English with an APLS emphasis explore the influence of language on society by examining its use in authentic contexts. The scope of APLS also allows students to investigate first language acquisition and second language learning; social, regional, and global language varieties; discourse and conversation analysis; language and gender; the origins and development of the English language; and cross-cultural communication differences.
