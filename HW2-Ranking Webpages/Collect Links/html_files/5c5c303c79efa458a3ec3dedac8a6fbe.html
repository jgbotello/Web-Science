About this Program

The Ph.D. in Public Administration and Policy program develops expert leaders and scholars in public and nonprofit administration and policy who are capable of creating and disseminating knowledge that advances public service in a multi-sector environment. Today, effective public administration and policy-making often requires collaborative decisions and problem solving. We take a multi-sector approach, focusing the challenges that arise where governments, nonprofits, businesses, community groups, and individuals intersect. Our program is compatible with most previous academic areas and careers, such as political science, criminal justice, social work, engineering, business, fine arts, environmental sciences, education, etc.
