Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Chemistry at ODU?
Students entering the Master of Science program in Chemistry should meet the minimum university admission requirements Graduate Admission.


  An application, transcripts, two letters of recommendation from former college instructors, a resume, a writing sample and an essay about career goals. The Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is optional for all domestic applicants and strongly recommend for international applicants. International students are also required to submit an Internet Based TOEFL Score (iBT) which includes a Speaking Portion. Admission to regular status requires a grade point average of 3.00 in the major and 2.80 overall (on a 4.00 scale). General university admission requirements also apply. In addition, a Bachelor of Science degree (or equivalent) with a major in chemistry (or another science) is required, although applications from majors in all science disciplines are encouraged. Undergraduate courses in organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, analytical chemistry (quantitative and instrumental analysis), physical chemistry, and calculus are required for regular admission. Deficiencies in any of these areas will be identified and must be rectified by taking undergraduate coursework.
