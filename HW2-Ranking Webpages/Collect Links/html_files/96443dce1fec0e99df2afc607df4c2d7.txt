About this Program

The degree is intended for students who want to get broader knowledge in ECE. The MS degree students have three study options: 1) course only: take ten courses beyond their BS degree and pass a Master Comprehensive Exam, 2) project: take nine courses beyond the BS degree and do a master project with an ECE faculty mentor, and 3) thesis: take eight courses beyond the BS degree and do a master thesis with an ECE faculty advisor. The MS thesis option is intended for students who want the opportunity to develop research expertise in a specific ECE area. For this option, students must do research under direct advising by an ECE faculty member in their chosen area of specialization, write and defend an original thesis.




Program Highlights


ECE faculty support University centers such as the Applied Research Center, the Frank Reidy Center of Bioelectrics, and the Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center


Additional research facilities in the Hampton Roads area with ECE faculty collaboration include National Institute of Aerospace, NASA Langley Research Center and Jefferson Lab


Offers opportunities for advanced course work as well as challenging research projects to prepare students for leadership roles in engineering careers with industry, government, research organizations, or educational institutions


Stresses both theoretical and practical aspects of Electrical and Computer Engineering by combining the teaching and research expertise of the ECE faculty with additional research resources in the Hampton Roads area through department labs and university centers/institutes


Faculty are very active in conducting cutting-edge research projects which provide both research experiences and financial support for qualified graduate students


The ECE department has research laboratories focusing on Applied Plasma Technology; Cybersecurity, Communications and Networking Innovation; Microelectronics and Thin Film Devices; Medical Imaging, Diagnosis, and Analysis; Power Research; Systems Analysis of Metabolic Physiology; Systems Research; Virginia Institute for Photovoltaics; and Vision Lab
