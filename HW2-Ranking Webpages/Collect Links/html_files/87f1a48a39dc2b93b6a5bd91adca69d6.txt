Visa & Immigration Service Advising










Visa & Immigration Service Advising is committed to offering immigration advising and support services that help ensure the academic and personal success of our international students and scholars, including their families. Additionally, we support departments and colleges in hiring international researchers and faculty. Our services include:

Advising on facilitating compliance with U.S. immigration regulations
Assisting with employment and tax paperwork
Aiding with non-academic, personal and cultural challenges
Supporting health insurance usage and compliance
Offering financial support for international student professional development through the ISAB Scholarship
Facilitating the Global Certificate Program for ODU faculty, staff and graduates assistants
Providing notary services, support letters, and tax filling assistance

International students are defined as "non-immigrant" visitors who come to the United States temporarily to take classes or take online courses virtually from anywhere in the world. A non-immigrant is someone who meets one or more of the following criteria:

intends to stay in the US temporarily.
does not have US citizenship or legal permanent resident status (a valid "green card")
currently is in the US on a non-immigrant visa status (without a valid green card)
applies for a visa to be allowed entry into the US.

In the United States, there are three primary student visa types: F, J, and M.












Check-In for New International Students
Newly admitted international students and international students returning to start a new academic program must Check-In Online with Visa & Immigration Service Advising (VISA) as soon as possible after arrival to the United States. International Student Check-In is a federally mandated process that requires every international student to report their information to VISA and have their immigration documents reviewed. We ask that you do not submit the eform before you arrive in the United States.
The online check-in form can be accessed here.
ALL required documents are to be scanned in color and uploaded; photos are not accepted.
