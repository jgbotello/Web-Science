TRiO McNair













About
The Ronald E. McNair Program helps eligible undergraduates pursue graduate degrees. The program offers expanded faculty mentoring, research experience and other academic opportunities with the goal of increasing the number of Ph.D. recipients who are from underrepresented groups in graduate education. The program consists of summer and academic year activities. Students will enter the program during the spring, participate in the summer research component and, during the following academic year complete the requirements for graduate school enrollment.
For more information please email TRiOMcNair@odu.edu.
