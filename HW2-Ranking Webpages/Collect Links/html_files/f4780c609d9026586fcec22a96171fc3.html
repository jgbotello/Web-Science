About this Program

The need for financial planners continues to grow. Estimates of employment growth in these fields range from 41% (US Department of Labor) to 30.1% (AOL jobs survey), over the next ten years. One of the most significant issues facing an individual and their family is how to manage and protect their assets, income and investments. The U.S. economy has transitioned from a one where people retire securely with a pension after spending a lifetime with an employer. We are now in a world of defined contribution plans where each individual is responsible for creating and managing their own retirement program. Additionally, navigating the worlds of taxes, insurance, education funding, all compound the stress we all face. Individuals and their families need advice from professionals who are able to integrate all aspects of personal finance. These include insurance, investments, employee benefits, taxes, and estate planning. That is role of the personal financial planner.
