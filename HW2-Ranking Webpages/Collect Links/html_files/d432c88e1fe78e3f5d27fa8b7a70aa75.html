About this Program

Medical laboratory science is a challenging and rewarding healthcare profession. An essential member of the healthcare team, the medical technologist/medical laboratory scientist provides vital information about the status and function of the body and its systems. Students acquire the skills and knowledge needed to provide data, obtained by precision instruments and electronic equipment, that is utilized in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disease. When the B.S. in Medical Laboratory Science degree requirements are successfully completed, the graduate is eligible for MLS examination and certification through the Board of Certification of the American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP).




Program Highlights


Microscopy and performance of manual assays with dexterity and precision


Quality control, quality assurance and performance improvement


Utilization of a computerized information system for data input, retrieval and analysis


Service learning projects are available such as the annual Faye E. Coleman Memorial blood drive sponsored by Medical Laboratory Science Student Association (MLSSA).


Medical laboratory instrument operation, maintenance and troubleshooting critical assessment of laboratory test outcomes


Clinical laboratory rotations at eight major health systems or hospitals in the area, excellent MLS certification pass rates, nearly 100% job placement rates every year
