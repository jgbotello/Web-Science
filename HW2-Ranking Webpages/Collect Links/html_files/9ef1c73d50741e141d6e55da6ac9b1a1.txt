About this Program

The Department of Women’s and Gender Studies is a multi- and interdisciplinary field of study that examines the complex intersections of gender, race, class, sexuality, ability, nation, and other identities, with an emphasis on women’s lives and perspectives. A minor in Women's Studies complements any major, as it prepares students to work with diverse populations, with an understanding of what it takes to empower themselves and others to become change makers. This skill set makes our students highly competitive on the job market, as employers increasingly seek candidates with intersectional expertise. Department faculty work closely with students to help them learn how to engage in complex problem solving; connect with others across differences; and engage diverse communities.




Program Highlights


Women’s Studies prepares students to contribute to a variety of fields—as advocates for justice, human rights, and equality. We offer distinct opportunities to get involved in organizations through internships, service-learning, and professional development series. Our department is supported by an active Friends of Women’s Studies organization that provides four scholarships, a range of events, and networking opportunities. Women’s Studies graduates work in a range of fields—from social work, to law, to education, and international development. This department allows students to learn theories of social justice and apply them to benefit not only women and girls, but in a range of contexts where graduates can promote equality and human rights.
