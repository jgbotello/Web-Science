About this Program

This minor is designed to develop management-related skills through an understanding of applied ethics, effective communication, processes in organizations, applied psychology, and legal issues in the workplace. An appreciation for the qualities of leadership, the functions of administration, and a sensitivity for ethical decision making will allow the student to apply for a wider variety of positions.




Program Highlights


Designed for students looking for careers in administration in medical, business, or other fields


Focuses on exposing students to the types of ethical decisions they will have to make in their future career and assists them in developing the necessary skills to make with them


Some classes in the minor may also satisfy general education or departmental prerequisites, so students may only need to take a couple of additional classes to complete the minor
