            Speaking to the class of 2022
          


"ODU has a time-honored tradition of providing a diverse and welcoming community where we learn from different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. As a close campus and caring community, we demonstrate understanding and respect for each other. This has defined ODU for many decades, and it will continue as we move forward. Together, we are Monarch Strong!"
