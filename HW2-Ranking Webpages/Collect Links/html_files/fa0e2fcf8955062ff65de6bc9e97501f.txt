Title IX Resources











            About
      


Old Dominion University is committed to providing support and resources to assist students and employees who encounter sexual assault, domestic and dating violence, and stalking.
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 is a federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in education. Sex discrimination includes sexual harassment, which may encompass these above forms of relationship violence.
The University has a designated Title IX Coordinator, who is responsible for determining what constitutes discrimination/sexual harassment, and reviews related complaints, reports and concerns. For additional information regarding Title IX, please visit the Office of Institutional Equity & Diversity website.
The University's Title IX Policy describes how ODU enforces federal law that prohibits sexual harassment and violence. It describes the University process for reporting, reviewing and investigating and adjudicating cases based on hearing processes. For more information about the Title IX process as it pertains to students, please contact the Title IX Coordinator at TitleIXCoordinator@odu.edu.

            Title IX and Clery
      


Employee Reporting Requirements
With the exception of employees serving as Title IX confidential resources (University Victim Advocate, Counseling Services & Student Health Services), other employees, including the Deputy Title IX Coordinator are required to report related concerns that have been disclosed to them to the Title IX Coordinator by using this sexual harassment/violence incident form. Should you have any questions regarding your reporting obligations please contact the Title IX Coordinator at TitleIXCoordinator@odu.edu
The Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery) is a federal law that requires colleges and universities to disclose information about crime on and around their campuses. Most division employees have been identified as campus security authorities are required to report most felony crimes to include sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, and stalking. Inclusion of personally identifiable information (the victim and/or accused name, etc.) is not required, but the inclusion of such information, if known, may assist the University in providing services and eliminating the possibility of double-counting incidents. Please refer to the ODU Police Department website for a more detailed description of the Clery crimes and reporting requirements. Division employees that are campus security authorities should report incidents directly to the police by completing this Clery Form. Should you have any questions about your status as a campus security authority, please contact the university's Clery Compliance Coordinator, at cleryact@odu.edu
Please note the Clery Form is NOT a method of notifying police of an emergency, dangerous situation, or other hazard. The submission of the CSA Report will NOT prompt a police investigation or generate an official police report or case number. In the event of an emergency call ODU Police at 757-683-4000 or 9-1-1, if the incident has not occurred on campus.

















            Report a Concern
          


To assist Old Dominion University in complying with the federally mandated Clery Act, this form should be utilized by Campus Security Authorities (CSA) to report crimes to the Clery Coordinator as soon as possible after a crime has been reported to the CSA.
