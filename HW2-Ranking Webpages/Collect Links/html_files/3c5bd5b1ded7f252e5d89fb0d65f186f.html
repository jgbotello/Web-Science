About this Program

The College offers an interdisciplinary Doctor of Engineering (D.Eng.) program to provide the Commonwealth and the nation with exceptionally educated engineering practitioners. These individuals will have developed the highest possible capability to provide innovative solutions in specialized engineering endeavors. The graduates of the program will meet the highest standards for advanced level engineering and leadership positions in industry and government.




Program Highlights


The department has strong ties to the world-renowned Center for Bioelectrics, where ECE faculty are working on innovative ways to use pulsed electric fields to cure cancer


ECE faculty support University centers such as the Applied Research Center, the Frank Reidy Center of Bioelectrics, and the Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center


Additional research facilities in the Hampton Roads area with ECE faculty collaboration include National Institute of Aerospace, NASA Langley Research Center and Jefferson Lab


The ECE department has research laboratories focusing on Applied Plasma Technology; Cybersecurity, Communications and Networking Innovation; Microelectronics and Thin Film Devices; Medical Imaging, Diagnosis, and Analysis; Power Research; Systems Analysis of Metabolic Physiology; Systems Research; Virginia Institute for Photovoltaics; and Vision Lab


A very important component of the Ph.D. degree is the original research pursued by the student which culminates in a written dissertation, as well as an oral defense of this work. Ph.D. students usually publish the result of their research in highly reputable nationally and internationally refereed journals
