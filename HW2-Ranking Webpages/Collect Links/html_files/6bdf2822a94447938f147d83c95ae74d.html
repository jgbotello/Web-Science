Alonzo Brandon, vice president of University Advancement and executive director of Foundations at Old Dominion University, has been selected as the 2024 Mentor of the Year for District III of the Council for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE). Per the CASE website, this award recognizes an individual who has made an impact on other advancement professionals through their mentorship. 
Brandon, who graduated from ODU in 1985 with a bachelor’s degree in business administration, has served at the University since 1993. He currently oversees the offices of Development, Alumni Relations and Foundations, working to connect the community and ODU alumni to opportunities at the University. 
In his more than 30 years at ODU, Brandon has raised more than $250 million and managed a fundraising initiative that led to the largest single gift in the University’s history of $37 million, given to establish the Barry Art Museum. He also helped launch the Strome Entrepreneurial Center, the CIVIC Scholars Program and the Football Program.
Brandon currently leads ODU’s “Forward-Focused: For Dreams and Beyond” initiative, a $500 million capital campaign to fund scholarships and research opportunities for students, attract top faculty, invest in health sciences, deliver new athletic scholarships and ensure the campus continues to offer high quality, modern facilities for living and learning. 
In addition to his work at ODU, Brandon has been a member of the boards of directors of the CIVIC Leadership Institute, TowneBank, Giving Black Hampton Roads Advisory Council, Watershed Action Team for the Elizabeth River Project, Trinity Lutheran School, Virginia Beach Vision and WHRO. Prior to joining the university, he served as President of Full Court Press Inc.; Publisher of InSyte Magazine, a local Hampton Roads publication; and founded InSyte Advertising, which published a magazine and offered related services.
Krista Harrell, associate vice president of Alumni Relations and a three-time graduate of ODU, credits Brandon for his impact on her career.
“In my own journey, Alonzo took a chance on me, hiring me back at our beloved University because he believed in my potential and what I could contribute to the institution and enhance the experience for our nearly 170,000 alumni,” she said. “This vote of confidence has been a defining moment in my career, and I am forever grateful for his mentorship and guidance.”
