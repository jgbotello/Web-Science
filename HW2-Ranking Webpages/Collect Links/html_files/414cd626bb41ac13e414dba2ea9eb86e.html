About this Program

The computer engineering program is designed to provide a broad engineering background and a comprehensive foundation in the technical principles underlying the computer area. The technical core consists of coursework from electrical engineering to address hardware aspects of computer engineering and coursework from computer science to address software aspects. The curriculum builds on the hardware description language tools introduced in the sophomore year to master the design, test and synthesis of advanced digital circuits.




Program Highlights


The ECE department has research laboratories focusing on Applied Plasma Technology; Cybersecurity, Communications and Networking Innovation; Microelectronics and Thin Film Devices; Medical Imaging, Diagnosis, and Analysis; Power Research; Systems Analysis of Metabolic Physiology; Systems Research; Virginia Institute for Photovoltaics; and Vision Lab.


ECE faculty support University centers such as the Applied Research Center, the Frank Reidy Center of Bioelectrics, and the Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center.


Additional research facilities in the Hampton Roads area with ECE faculty collaboration include the National Institute of Aerospace, NASA Langley Research Center and Jefferson Lab.

FUND OF COMPUTER ENGN LAB





This course develops the foundation of computer engineering for computer engineers as well as an introductory breadth appropriate for electrical engineers. Class topics include computer information, digital design (combinational and sequential circuits), computer organization, and assembly language. The laboratory includes building digital circuits (focusing on programmable logic), assembly language programming, and system interfacing. The use of a hardware description language is employed in class and the laboratory to specify, simulate and synthesize digital circuits. Prerequisites: CS 150 or ENGN 150 and MATH 211 with a grade of C or above for both.
