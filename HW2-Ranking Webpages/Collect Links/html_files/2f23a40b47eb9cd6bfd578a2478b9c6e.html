Rhode Islanders deserve a safe, modern transit center with state-of-the-art amenities, and we are committed to making that a reality.
Throughout this project, we will be engaging with riders, advocates, and other stakeholders in a robust public process to collaboratively locate and design this new transit center.
About this Project
What
We will be constructing a new, modern transit center with state-of-the-art amenities based on feedback from riders and RIPTA drivers.
This new transit center will improve rider safety. It will include adequate lighting, and an emphasis on pedestrian safety. We want to create a transit center that does not require riders to cross many streets. Passengers will be able to transfer in an environment that is safe and controlled. This center will also be interconnected to other transit options, built to minimize transfers and maximize efficiency for riders. It will include a direct link to the Providence Train Station, Kennedy Plaza, the Rhode Island Convention Center, and other high-traffic areas.
Why
RIPTA has outgrown its current hub at Kennedy Plaza, and the limitations of that space prevent construction of the type of modern, safe, indoor facility that riders deserve.
A transit center in the middle of a public park and skating center is a challenging dynamic that has created tension between the varying uses. Bus stops are not convenient to get to – passengers have to cross Exchange Terrace or Washington Street or walk through the park.
In the new transit center, restaurants and retail will be designed around transit services. Transit comes first, and everything else would be co-located.
RIPTA is focused on improving bus service, including adding frequency to routes and expanding our hours of operations. Because of the limitations of the space at Kennedy Plaza, our passengers deserve improved service, more amenities, bus connections that prioritize pedestrian safety, a spacious indoor waiting area – things RIPTA cannot offer in Kennedy Plaza.Additionally, RIPTA does not own property in Kennedy Plaza; we are a tenant. Having control of our own property in downtown Providence would give RIPTA the ability to build better infrastructure for transit passengers. This is a real opportunity to move our system forward.
Public Engagement
This siting and design process will be guided by the public, and we are committed to including the voices of all stakeholders in each step of this project.
The second public engagement session will be held on Thursday, May 30, 2024 from 4 – 7 p.m.at the CCRI Knight Campus in Warwick. This will be a chance for members of the public to provide their feedback on this project. CLICK HERE TO RSVP.
Additional public engagement sessions will be held regularly throughout this process – check back here for more information or sign up for our newsletter here.
If you are unable to make it to these sessions or want to provide feedback by email, please send your thoughts to transitcenter@ripta.com
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
KENNEDY PLAZA



Why is RIPTA moving its transit center?
RIPTA is a growing agency that is focused on improving bus service, including adding frequency to routes and expanding our hours of operations.  When combined with the fact that RIPTA has outgrown Kennedy Plaza, we cannot provide any additional service during weekday peak hours because of the challenges of the current space. Our passengers deserve improved service, more amenities, bus connections that do not require walking through a park at night, a spacious indoor waiting area – things RIPTA cannot offer in Kennedy Plaza.
Additionally, RIPTA does not own property in Kennedy Plaza; we are a tenant. Having control of our own property in downtown Providence is something the Authority has never had. Having that would give RIPTA the ability to build better infrastructure for transit passengers.  This is a real opportunity to move our system forward.

Will there still be bus service in Kennedy Plaza after RIPTA moves?
Yes. RIPTA will maintain 5-minute frequency to Kennedy Plaza through the Downtown Transit Connector (DTC).

What will the impact be on the highly vulnerable population that relies on RIPTA?
A transit center in the middle of a public park and skating center is an odd dynamic that has created tension between the varying uses. A public park encourages people to hang out in green space.  As a transit agency, RIPTA is interested in getting people in and out of the city to their destinations. RIPTA does not want to create a space that stigmatizes people. We understand that there is a highly vulnerable population that relies on transit to get around; we do not want to negatively affect them.  RIPTA is committed to protecting this population as we transition to a new transit center. This includes clear communication and outreach efforts, as well as coordinating with social service providers throughout this project.





Can RIPTA invest money into improving Kennedy Plaza instead of creating a new transit center?
No. The dollar amount does not matter – Kennedy Plaza is ultimately a public park with limited opportunities to improve transit within the plaza.  This severely limits RIPTA’s ability to expand transit in Kennedy Plaza; there is a limited amount of available transit space.   Additionally, RIPTA does not own property in Kennedy Plaza; we are a tenant. RIPTA does not own or have a right to that space beyond the terms of the lease.

Are commercial real estate investors motivating this project?
No. In 2014, voters approved a $35M bond to improve transit infrastructure.  RIPTA’s primary motivation for proposing a new transit center location is to improve the transit network and to prepare for growth. RIPTA has always discussed some level of moving out of Kennedy Plaza and building a better transit center for our passengers.




AMENITIES



What new amenities will the Providence Transit Center have?
We are conducting public outreach to learn what types of amenities our riders and RIPTA drivers would like to see in a new transit center.




PROVIDENCE TRANSIT CENTER



Will RIPTA own the building?
Yes. RIPTA will own a portion of the transit center so that we have control over our own property and will be able to ensure a high level and continuity of service to our passengers.

How much will the Transit Center Cost?
In Phase 1, Next Wave Partners will work with RIPTA and the public to locate, design, and price the project to ensure that it reflects community values while remaining affordable.

How will RIPTA fund this project?
In 2014, voters approved a $35M mass transit hub infrastructure bond that allows the State of Rhode Island to fund enhancements and renovations to mass transit hub infrastructure. RIPTA can utilize these funds as a state match to apply for other federal grant opportunities. In addition, a public-private partnership enables RIPTA to tap into expanded private capital opportunities.

What will RIPTA do to improve safety at this new transit center?
RIPTA will work on designing a building – and the environment around it – that prioritizes safety as the project moves forward. This includes adequate lighting, strategically placed emergency callboxes, an emergency evacuation plan and an emphasis on pedestrian safety. We want to create a transit center that does not require riders to cross many streets. Passengers will be able to transfer in an environment that is as safe and controlled as possible.

Will there be bike lanes?
RIPTA does not have jurisdiction over the road network, but RIPTA will coordinate with the City of Providence and RIDOT to work towards this.





How will RIPTA logistically fit all of what is in Kennedy Plaza at this new transit center?
Kennedy Plaza is a sprawling space – there is the plaza proper that RIPTA operates which includes bus shelters, the area next to Burnside Park and the bus stops on Exchange Terrace. There is no way to consolidate all of those things into that one area – there is a public park and skating rink there. You cannot make that footprint smaller. However, RIPTA can fit more into a smaller footprint because we do not have to work around unmovable existing assets; more can fit into a smaller space by design. RIPTA is working with RIDOT and its planning team to ensure that we can fit into what we are proposing here. We are confident there is enough space at this proposed site to accommodate future transit growth.

Will there be interior and exterior digital signage with real-time bus arrival information?
Yes. RIPTA is committed to clear, accessible signage.

What hours will the transit center be open?
The building will be open during transit service hours, and will have customer service representatives available.

Will passengers have to walk further to get to their destination?
RIPTA recently conducted a rider survey that looked at the beginning and ending of passengers’ destinations. RIPTA will analyze that data as we go through this process. The goal is to minimize the walk distances for people if they are going somewhere other than Kennedy Plaza.




TRAIN AND INTERSTATE CONNECTIONS



Will there be a connection to the train station?
Yes. The DTC, and other select routes, will run directly from this new transit center to the train station. It will be coordinated in a way that makes sense for passengers.

Has there been a traffic study to confirm that streets and sidewalks can safely handle the increased capacity of traffic and pedestrians, as well as ambulances traveling to RI Hospital?
RIPTA will work with RIDOT traffic engineers to make sure this project does not create gridlock in downtown Providence.





How will interstate coach buses connect here (Peter Pan, etc.)?
We do not anticipate there being sufficient space to accommodate interstate coach buses at this facility, but it will be explored during the design process. Passengers can ride Routes 27, 28 or 92 to the RI Convention Center to make this connection.

Did RIPTA consider building a transit center at Providence Station?
Yes. RIPTA put a lot of effort into looking at building a transit center at Providence Station. Unfortunately, the development and usability for that space is extremely limited.




PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS (P3)



What is a Public-Private Partnership (P3)?
A Public-Private Partnership is a way to deliver a project that allows a public agency (RIPTA) to coordinate directly with a private developer to both construct the facility and provide for the long-term operations and maintenance of the facility. RIPTA will be designing and developing the transit center alongside Next Wave Partners and opening each stage of the process to public input. This approach will ensure RIPTA has input at all stages of the development and can access the private-sector funding and expertise needed to successfully deliver a project of this scale. 

Isn’t Kennedy Plaza already a mixed-use space?
Yes, Kennedy Plaza is mixed-use space.  The primary difference is that there is a historic public park in the middle of Kennedy Plaza. Bus stops are not convenient to get to – passengers have to cross Exchange Terrace or Washington Street or walk through the park. In the new transit center, restaurants and retail will be designed around transit services. Transit comes first. Everything else would be co-located.

The private sector has different motivations than the public sector. How will RIPTA balance that?
RIPTA is aware that there are risks that need to be considered and mitigated through the design of this project. RIPTA will bring in the right expertise to create a beneficial arrangement, which includes commitments for accessibility, workforce, daily maintenance, retail management and more.





Who is leading this process?
Next Wave Partners was selected by RIPTA in January 2024 through a bidding process and will be collaborating with RIPTA through a Public-Private Partnership (P3) model. Next Wave Partners is a consortium comprised of Gilbane Development Company,  Marsella Development, Plenary Americas, Gilbane Building Company, CUBE 3, and Jacobs.

Why is RIPTA considering a P3 for this project?
A P3 would provide RIPTA with access to private capital, as well as the private-sector partner’s skills and assets, that can help bring additional resources and revenue so that RIPTA can build the transit center that its passengers deserve.

What type of housing will be included in this building?
RIPTA is committed to including housing that will be affordable.  As the project develops, RIPTA will continue working with partner agencies and groups that specialize in housing to ensure the housing element is consistent with best practices in that area.

What are some examples of other P3s?

Denver Union Station
Potrero Yard Modernization (San Francisco)





TRANSIT MASTER PLAN (TMP)



How does this new transit center fit into the TMP?
The TMP calls for increased frequency and span of service, new modes of transportation, and better connectivity. This facility will be designed will all of those goals in mind.





Are there are any plans to have routes not to go to the transit center, but travel on main thoroughfares instead?
Yes. A recurrent theme RIPTA heard during outreach for its Transit Master Plan was that passengers do not want to transfer downtown when it does not make sense to. RIPTA is looking into implementing cross-town routes. 




TRANSITION PERIOD



Will RIPTA help people with disabilities, including low vision, low hearing and mental health, and the elderly during the transition period to the new transit center?
Yes.  RIPTA is committed to making this a seamless transition for all passengers – especially vulnerable riders. RIPTA has consulted with our Accessible Transportation Advisory Committee (ATAC) on this project to date and will continue to engage them and consult as many groups as possible to make this transition a smooth one.
RIPTA will plan for extensive outreach once the transit center is open. This includes helping passengers find their bus stop location and access amenities. 




NEXT STEPS



What is the project timeframe?
In January 2024, RIPTA entered Phase 1 of the project, which is focused on soliciting community input and developing and designing the project parameters. We expect the first phase to take a year and a half.





Will RIPTA continue to engage the public throughout this process?
Yes. Yes, the public will be heavily involved in commenting on the vision and design plans for the new transit center. As soon as dates are set, we will share them widely.
The many comments and suggestions provided to date by the public, including improving the rider experience with climate-controlled indoor and covered/heated outdoor waiting areas, seating, improved wayfinding, information and ticketing systems, bicycle storage and repair stations, were incorporated into the RFP.
