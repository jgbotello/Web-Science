About this Program

This minor complements many academic programs and majors by providing knowledge and experience in the 12 core competency areas identified by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMSHA] as vital to knowledge, skills and attitudes required for professional practice in addiction services. In addition to fulfilling core competency areas required for addiction services, courses in this minor may meet the didactic education requirements for addiction credentialing, such as the Certified Substance Abuse Counselor (CSAC) credential in Virginia.
