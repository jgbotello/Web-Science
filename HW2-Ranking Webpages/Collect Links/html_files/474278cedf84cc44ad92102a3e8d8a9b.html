Testing at ODU








Testing at ODU makes it easy to achieve your educational, professional, and personal testing goals! At the main campus in Norfolk, testing for ODU students is housed on the fourth floor of Perry Library. This center is open only to ODU students.
Also in Norfolk, the Credentialing Center houses credit bearing and industry certification exams. Aligning with the University's strategic plan, the Center is at the forefront of community engagement, and offers opportunities to ODU students and the general public to enhance their skills and employment/earnings potential.
Offering a combination of internal and external exams, the University's Regional Higher Education Centers are located throughout Hampton Roads and provide convenient options for your testing needs.
