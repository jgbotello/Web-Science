About this Program

The study of the history of art promotes visual and cultural literacy, critical and independent thinking, and advanced research and communication skills. ODU offers a BA in Art History, as well as a minor in Art History. The major and minor in Art History is designed to effectively function as a stand-alone major/minor, while also complementing other majors/minors within the Art Department, College of Arts and Letters and across the University. After a survey of world art from ancient to contemporary, students take a series of tiered courses in three broad periods of art—Ancient to Medieval, Early Modern, and Modern and Contemporary—that allows students to build their skills in research and writing. Advanced majors may take courses in their areas of interest, pursue internships at museums and other cultural venues, and conduct independent research with faculty advisors. The art history program of study culminates with the writing of an original senior thesis or capstone project.
