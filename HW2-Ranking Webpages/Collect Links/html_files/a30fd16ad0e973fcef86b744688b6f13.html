About this Program

The program leading to the Ph.D. in Education with a concentration in Educational Leadership is designed to prepare educational leaders for a wide variety of professional positions in PK-12 administration and supervision, higher education, and state and national policy making arenas. The goal is to prepare professionals who possess the knowledge and skills needed to provide leadership and to produce meaningful change in educational organizations with the underlying premise of social justice.




Program Highlights


The Cohort is designed for educational leaders working full-time in PK-12 schools, divisions, and other educational organizations. PK-12 school leaders take classes as part of a cohort in which students discuss and research educational problems of practice and policy. Course content is designed to help students use research, theory, and their own professional expertise to advance organizational change in their own organizations


Our courses, offered once a week, are held in the evening during the work week (not on Fridays, Saturdays, or Sundays).
