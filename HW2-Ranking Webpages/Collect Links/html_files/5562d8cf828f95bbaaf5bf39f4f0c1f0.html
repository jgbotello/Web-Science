Veterans









Military veterans who need transportation support are encouraged to contact the Rhode Island Office of Veterans Services (RIVETS) and complete the request assistance form or contact RIVETS at (401) 921-2175 with any questions.
Qualified U.S. military veterans are encouraged to apply for RIPTA’s reduced fare programs as they may be eligible for transportation benefits on RIPTA’s fixed-route service.
RIPTA offers a reduced fare bus pass program for low-income seniors (age 65 or over) and low-income persons with disabilities. Qualifying participants in this no fare program are issued a “Valid All Day” photo identification card that they use to board the bus. To apply for this program or learn more about it, please  CLICK HERE.
RIPTA also complies with federal transit guidelines and offers half-fare boarding to seniors and persons with disabilities, regardless of income, during OFF PEAK hours. Passengers enrolled in this program are issued “Valid Off Peak” photo identification cards. These passengers pay full fare during RIPTA peak service hours (7am-9am and 3pm-6pm) on weekdays. They can also use a Medicare Card to board. If they would like to obtain a RIPTA Photo ID card for this discount, they can apply online.
The passes issued for these programs are valid for two years and there is a $10 processing fee per issuance.  They are not transferable and will be confiscated if used by another individual that is not the person pictured on the pass. There is also a fee to replace cards that are lost or stolen.
Special Promotions
RIPTA periodically offers special promotions to military veterans. To learn more, sign up for RIPTA’s e-newsletter, and follow RIPTA on social media. For more information on veterans’ services in Rhode Island, please visit: http://www.vets.ri.gov/.
