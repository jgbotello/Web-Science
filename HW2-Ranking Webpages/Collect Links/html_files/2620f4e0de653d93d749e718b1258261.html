About this Program

This interdisciplinary minor encourages an interdisciplinary approach to the problems and crucial issues that emerge from urban environments. Students gain an understanding of the issues associated with the convergence of diverse populations in urban locations and acquire an appreciation of the complexities of the interlocking and contingent nature of urban problems. This will be accomplished through an examination of the topical areas of common space, diversity, urban services, disorder, and work.
