Online Undergraduate Program 
Why this degree?
Our online Bachelor of Computer Science degree allows students to finish their undergraduate degrees in a dynamic and innovative online learning environment, where traditional instructional methods are merged with modern technology. The program is offered 100 percent online, which means you can move your career forward from any location and earn a diploma from a nationally recognized university on your own terms.
As an online student, you’ll join the Auburn Family, a warm community of fellow scholars which extends beyond our physical campus and into our innovative online network, helping to keep you connected to your peers and professors every step of the way.

You meet admissions criteria as one of the following student types:
Transfer Students
Freshman Transfer (Less than 30 hours)

More information on transferring
Students who already have a bachelor’s degree
Already completed a bachelor’s degree? If you graduated with a GPA of 2.5 or higher (on a 4.0 scale), then you automatically fulfill all core requirements and can fast-track into our online BCS program.
To complete the program, you must...
Complete 20 courses, broken down into 18 core courses and 2 electives, for a total of 60 credit hours of computer science course work at graduation. These courses must be taken in addition to the university core coursework required for transfer students. There are five 7.5 week terms each year (two in Fall and Spring and one in Summer) to complete these courses in.
