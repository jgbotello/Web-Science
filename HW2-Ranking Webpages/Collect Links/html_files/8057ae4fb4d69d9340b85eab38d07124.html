Visitor Parking













            Welcome to ODU!
      









            Visitor Tips
          



ALL vehicles parked on campus requires a valid ODU parking permit or hourly parking payment!
Hourly parking requires immediate payment upon parking your vehicle.
Disability Parking requires valid ADA Placard/Plate plus parking permit or hourly parking payment.
When in doubt, contact us for help.













Visitors and guests driving to ODU have several options for parking on campus: Daily Permit, Weekly Permit, 30-Day Permit, or hourly parking. Payment must be made immediately upon parking your vehicle. Parking Regulations are strictly enforced, so please ALWAYS use a permit or pay-to-park to avoid enforcement (citations, booting, towing).
We encourage Faculty, Staff, and Students to direct their guests to use hourly parking. If visitors plan on staying for an entire day or weekend, we recommend they purchase a Daily Permit. If visitors plan on staying for a longer period of time we recommend they purchase a Weekly or 30-Day Permit.
Permits can be purchased online or in person at the Transportation & Parking Services (TPS) office located at 43rd & Elkhorn Garage.
Parking for Transportation & Parking Services customers is located in the 43rd & Elkhorn Garage for 15 minutes in spaces marked "15 Minute Parking" on Level 1.
