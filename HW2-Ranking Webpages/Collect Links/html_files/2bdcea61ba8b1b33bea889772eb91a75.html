Additionally, elective courses delve into various facets of these disciplines, enriching students' educational experiences.
Graduates from our programs find employment opportunities at prestigious organizations such as Oracle, Microsoft, Booz Allen Hamilton, BP (British Petroleum), Norfolk Southern, A.P. Møller, Northrop Grumman, CMA CGM, ZIM, Walmart, Dollar Tree, and governmental agencies.
Our faculty members drive innovation through research initiatives funded by prestigious entities such as the National Science Foundation, the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, and the U.S. Department of Transportation. Notably, our department's maritime research attained the eighth position globally in 2015, according to ISI Web of Science rankings.
