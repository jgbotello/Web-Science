Veterans Services













 

Veteran Services is run by the Military Connection Center (MCC) and the University Registrar. The MCC provides career counseling, assistance with the admission and enrollment process, and connects you to military-affiliated programs to enhance your college experience.
University Registrar handles everything associated with the VA and G.I. Bill®. The Registrar can assist you with how to use and understand your VA Education Benefits and certify your classes with the VA. Please direct all VA questions to the Registrar's Office via email or by calling 757-683-4425.
Be sure to check out the community lounge, study spaces, and cyber lounge for military-affiliated students in Monarch Hall.
