About this Program

This interdisciplinary minor explores the interwoven historical, cultural, aesthetic, perceptual, and technical domains of the designed world. That virtually all aspects of the human-built world are designed is a generally accepted belief. Creative planning and critical analysis of design dynamics are emphasized within these disciplinary course subjects.
