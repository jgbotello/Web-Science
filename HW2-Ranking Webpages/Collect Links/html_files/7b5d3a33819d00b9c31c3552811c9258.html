About this Program

The turn of the twenty-first century coincides with the first united European currency, the Euro. The Euro is emblematic of a new Europe, one that has become a major force not only in world politics but in the ever-evolving cultural landscape of the new millennium. The study of European cultures provides students with a unique understanding of the complex mosaic that is today’s Europe. In the increasingly competitive job market, a focus on European Studies is a valuable asset in any field. Students who minor in European Studies focus on different aspects of European culture, language, literature, film, politics, geography, philosophy, and history.

German Cinema I





The first half of the 20th century was the most creative and destructive period in German and European history. Its rich cultural achievements included Viennese psychoanalytical theory of the turn of the century, Art Nouveau, German Expressionism, and the avant garde aesthetics of the Weimar Republic. Conversely, World War I and II exposed the cultural agony and human depravity of modern civilization. This course will trace these various aspects and developments in a variety of exemplary genres. Readings and discussions in German. (Cross-listed with WCS 445/WCS 545 and COMM 444/COMM 544)
