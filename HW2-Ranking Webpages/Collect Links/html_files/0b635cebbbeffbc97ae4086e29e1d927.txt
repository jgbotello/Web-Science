        ENGL 550
            



American English





When people think of 'American English,' they usually have a standard form in mind. In this course, we focus on the variety of ways English is spoken in the U.S. and the social meaning of that variation. We also discuss language-based discrimination and strategies that can be used to confront it. Models for collecting, describing, and analyzing variation in American English are introduced and applied to real-life situations.
