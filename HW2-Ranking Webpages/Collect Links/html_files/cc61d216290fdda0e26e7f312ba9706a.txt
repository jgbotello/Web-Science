Brother 2 Brother (B2B)





















































































































































































We are our Brother's Keeper: Brotherhood, Service, Leadership, & Excellence."
Brother 2 Brother (B2B) is a nationally recognized dynamic organization dedicated specifically to assist African American, and Latinx men of color to excel academically, socially, culturally, and professionally.
B2B is based on a peer mentoring model where men of color connect, engage, support, and encourage each other to be successful in and outside of the classroom.
The Old Dominion University of Brother2Brother was established in the spring of 2018 and has experienced increases in membership each year.










            Mission

"B2B has played a pivotal role in helping me become who I want to be in the future. Being part of this group has helped me get out of my comfort zone and take initiative in my college career. Brother 2 Brother has helped me become more social and taught me the importance of networking with higher faculty. I'm grateful for Dr. Young because he's helped me navigate my college career for the better."










 



Devontae Allen
Secretary & Chief Academic Officer
"B2B has played an integral role in my student success since stepping foot on campus in Fall 2019. Brilliant black student leaders coached me on how to balance academics and extracurriculars and encouraged me to get involved with student government. The mentorship I've received from distinguished professionals such as Dr. Young has boosted my confidence to pursue all opportunities."










 



Diondre Brown
