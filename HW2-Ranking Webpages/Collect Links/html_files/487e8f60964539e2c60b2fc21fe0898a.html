About this Program

This program is aimed at providing understanding of energy engineering and the increasing role of energy engineers in addressing growing energy needs. The new skills and advanced understanding developed in class will prepare students for employment in rapidly growing energy industries. Students completing the Certificate will develop an understanding of the current status of energy issues and systems, and their management; learn about varying energy resources and technologies, such as petroleum, coal, natural gas, nuclear, solar, biomass, hydro-electric, and wind; be exposed to technical details on existing commercial processes and associated economics of various energy products; gain a better understanding of public policies to provide greater momentum to the energy industry; learn about the environmental impacts of the various energy systems; get credits for future studies in energy engineering in the Hampton Roads region; and acquire the skills and knowledge to be a part of the expert workforce for the energy industry.




Program Highlights


Enables participants to learn state-of-the-art techniques necessary for analyzing cyber security risks, preventing, detecting and recovering from cyber attacks through classroom instructions and hands-on lab work.


Accommodates students from engineering, math and sciences as well as practicing engineers and managers.


Program is designed both as a complement for students working on graduate degrees and for those personnel working on information and cyber systems used in industry, small businesses, healthcare, government, military and homeland security.


It is anticipated that students will complete the program in 2 semesters (full-time enrollment) or 2 years (part-time enrollment or working to complement an existing graduate program).
