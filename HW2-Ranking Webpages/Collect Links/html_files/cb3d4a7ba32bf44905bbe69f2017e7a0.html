About this Program

Cyber Operations is an interdisciplinary major encompassing the entire scope of cyberspace and related operations that are both technical and non-technical (i.e., ethical, legal, human-centered, etc.) in nature. Cyber Operations is a complementary discipline to Cybersecurity. Cyber Operations places a particular emphasis on technologies and techniques applicable to all operational and system levels. Coursework in Cyber Operations balances theory, practice and hands-on labs inspired by real-life scenarios. Skills and competencies emphasized are in system attack, infiltration, exploitation, defense, mitigation, and recovery.




Program Highlights


This major is one of only two programs in the Commonwealth of Virginia, and the only truly interdisciplinary one, that is designated by the National Security Agency as a Center of Academic Excellence.


Graduates from this program will have the skills and proficiencies that are critical to intelligence, military and law enforcement organizations authorized to perform these specialized operations.


ODU’s Cyber Operations major program is firmly grounded in the computer science, computer engineering, and/or electrical engineering disciplines, with extensive opportunities for hands-on applications via labs and exercises.
