About this Program

The masters in Ocean & Earth Science integrated curriculum uses active learning by promoting research and education. It is designed to give graduates the skill sets to prepare them for a range of careers in academia, and the public and private sectors. The graduate program in OEAS draws from the strength of our diverse faculty and their active research programs that span the globe. Graduate students have the opportunity to take part in research projects among a broad suite of field sites from the local waters of the Chesapeake Bay to the polar regions.




Program Highlights


Our graduate students present their research at national conferences, including the American Geophysical Union, Ocean Sciences and the Geological Society of America meetings


Community building is a strong aspect of graduate life in our Department thanks to our active Graduate Student Organization


Many of our graduate students participate in sea-going research expeditions around the world


We have faculty doing active research from here in Hampton Roads to the Arctic and Antarctic

Environmental Geochemistry





This course examines geochemical processes at and near the Earth?s surface, focusing on the concentration, speciation and reactivity of elements in soils, waters, sediments and the atmosphere. The course examines both the thermodynamic and kinetic controls on these processes, and the role of biology as a mediator (or facilitator) of these processes. Anthropogenic impacts on natural geochemical processes are also examined.
