About this Program

American Studies offers a unique opportunity to explore the cultures and societies of America from a perspective that is inherently interdisciplinary. This program provides a structured platform to encourage students to cross traditional academic boundaries and to integrate the arts, humanities, and social sciences. It is an effective program complement for those majoring in the related fields of art, music, dance and theatre; communication, English, and foreign languages; history, geography, and political science; philosophy; sociology, and criminal justice; as well as interdisciplinary majors in women's studies, African American and African studies, and international studies. The minor is also effective for international students, who may wish either to better understand American culture or to acquire an expertise useful in their home countries.




Program Highlights


Interdisciplinary program, allowing students to build their minor while learning how the idea of America is conceptualized across various forms and disciplines


Makes use of multi-media, extratextual formats, working from an understanding that we project some sense of our selves and our idea of nationhood into everything we produce


Students will acquire a deep and unique perspective on American history and culture that cannot be obtained anywhere else
