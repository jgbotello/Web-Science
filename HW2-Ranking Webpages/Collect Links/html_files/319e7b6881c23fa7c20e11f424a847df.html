The time & effort put into making this app more functional was a blessing. But there's still ONE issue, & it's HUGE to me. The ordering notifications. They are still nonexistent. I've set up the push notifications for the app. It doesn't ring until I open the app. It adds more to my day to constantly check my shop. And it could cost me orders & that isn't good for business. Please make the notifications work without opening the app.6 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoChris Carrollmore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 22, 2024It's the most discombobulated navigation system I have ever seen. So many freaking icons and selections done in such a vague way. The logistics and everything or just thrown together, and trying to get help on the app just near impossible. It seems like Amazon wants to avoid talking to customers and don't want to show your own ignorance of navigating through their app. It's flustered me to the point, that I discontinued selling on Amazon. It's that bad.78 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoRyan kinneymore_vert Flag inappropriateApril 14, 2024If I could leave a zero, I would. Absolutely horrid to deal with and set up initially, had no problem charging my account the 40 dollars a month fee, and over two weeks to finally gain access. Once finally on, there are so many hidden fees that there is no profit left for you to make money. Pushing free shipping to gain customers. Then paying the shipping fees on top. Literally loosing money selling items. Highly wouldn't recommend to anyone.78 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat's newBug fixes: Improvements for performance and stability.flagFlag as inappropriateApp supportexpand_morepublicWebsiteemailSupport emailseller-app-android-us-feedback@amazon.complaceAddressAMZN Mobile LLC
