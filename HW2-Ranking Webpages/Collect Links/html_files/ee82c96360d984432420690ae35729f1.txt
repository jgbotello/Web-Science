Licensing










The University Licensing Office protects and promotes the marks, names, and logos of Old Dominion University. Through a partnership with the Collegiate Licensing Company (CLC), the Licensing Office monitors use of the University's indicia and manages more than 180 licensees producing products bearing the institution's logos.
Revenues generated through the University's Licensing program are used to support scholarships for our students.












Our Mission

Ensure proper control and use of Trademarks associated with Old Dominion University.
Ensure that the University generates revenue for its students and programs through a reasonable license royalty for the use of its trademarks.
Promote the University in a consistent and uniform manner to protect its reputation, name and image by permitting only appropriate uses by officially licensed vendors and assuring that only quality products bear the University's Trademarks, to protect the consumer from inferior products bearing University Trademarks.

Old Dominion University's registered trademarks, as well as other names, seals, logos, school colors and other indicia ("University Trademarks ") that are representative of the University may be used solely with permission of Old Dominion University. Items offered for sale to the public bearing the University Trademarks must be licensed. Items manufactured for internal use, by students or staff or affiliates, must be first approved internally (as set out in more detail herein) and must be manufactured by a licensed vendor.
 















How Do You Know If It Is Licensed?
Look for the label! All CLC licensed vendors are required to identify their product with the Officially Licensed Collegiate Products label. With this label, alumni, students, fans and supporters know they are buying a product of quality and authenticity that has been manufactured in accordance with University set standards. Products that do not bear the label, but use the marks of Old Dominion University, may represent infringement of the trademark laws.

            The Process
          






1. CLC Review:





After the required paperwork is submitted to CLC (including any needed insurance information, marketing plans, etc.), the potential licensee and company information is sent to the University for review and approval. CLC will also forward any samples of product for the University to review production quality, and all relevant information to assist the University in the decision-making process.







2. University Review:





The University will then review the company information, the product and its quality, and decide on whether to approve the company as a licensee. The approval process may include all or some individuals from the licensing agent, University Office of Communications, and other parties as appropriate.







3. Decision Notification:





Approval (or disapproval) of the licensee by the University will be sent to CLC, who will notify the potential licensee of the decision. Once approval has been granted, the licensee may proceed with submitting products/artwork for approval.
