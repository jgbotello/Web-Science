About this Program

A minor in occupational safety is available in the environmental and occupational health program and requires a minimum of 12 semester hours of ENVH courses in safety. The minor in occupational safety is designed to prepare students to meet safety standards and guidelines in such areas as business, education and industry with the goal of managing operations to minimize financial losses resulting from accidents, health claims, legal actions and property damage. It is especially attractive to students in majors such as engineering, occupational and technical studies, and business who may reasonably anticipate assignment of safety as an additional duty.




Program Highlights


This minor prepares the students for positions in occupational safety and health, environmental safety and health, industrial hygiene, and government safety positions. Courses target safety management, hazard control, and safety regulations and laws.


Students practice management techniques through solving 12 Safety Dilemmas posed in a scenario as if the student were an industrial Safety Manager.


Students can gain hands-on experience with occupational safety equipment during the Principles of OSH course.
