About this Program

Technology education is a critical shortage teaching area in Virginia for middle school and high school. Technology education is not just learning about computers or other communications devices such as cell phones. Technology education studies the human designed world and is closely tied to science education which studies the natural environment. The technology education program includes the study of technological systems, processes, and artifacts and most major courses contain laboratory activities to help students understand the tools, materials, and principles associated with medical, agricultural, biological, energy and power, communication, transportation, manufacturing, and construction technologies.

Military Courses Transfer


#4 on the critical shortage teaching list in VA


Technology education students enjoy the hands-on nature of this program because in order to learn about technology, students do technological activities.


If students have a specialized technical major (AAS degree), these degrees help meet the technical content-general emphasis courses. Campus faculty can assist with all transfer questions.
