About this Program

The Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers a four-year undergraduate program leading to a Bachelor of Science Degree in Computer Engineering with a Major in Modeling and Simulation Engineering. The Modeling and Simulation Engineering Major will prepare students as modeling and simulation engineers of engineering systems with analog and digital hardware components and software aspects at its technical core with the advantage to extend the knowledge to other applications in engineering and the sciences. Students will gain skills necessary to create a concept or a design and testing it in real-world conditions through graphical and mathematical models, virtual reality simulations, software development, and data analysis.




Program Highlights


Old Dominion University is the first and only university in the nation to offer an undergraduate major in modeling and simulation engineering.


The ECE department has research laboratories focusing on Cybersecurity, Communications and Networking Innovation; Intelligent Transportation Systems; Medical Modeling and Simulation; Medical Imaging, Diagnosis, and Analysis; and Collaborative Autonomous Systems.


Advanced coursework in various topics include Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence, Data Analytics Engineering, Gaming, and Medical Modeling and Simulation.


The major couples with a strong research program conducted jointly with ODU's Virginia Modeling, Analysis and Simulation Center (VMASC), located nearby in Suffolk. Researchers are working in cutting-edge areas such as unmanned aircraft systems, medical and health care modeling and simulation, high-performance computing, big data, Virtual & Augmented Reality, and transportation systems.

Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Modeling and Simulation Engineering at ODU?
Students entering the Bachelor of Science program in Modeling and Simulation Engineering should meet the minimum university admission requirements Undergraduate Admission.


The Office of Admissions evaluates and admits freshmen based on high school performance, references and SAT scores. All incoming freshman engineering students are admitted to the Engineering Fundamentals Division


The ECE Department will officially declare a student as a computer engineering student once the following requirements are met:

Completion of 30 credit hours applicable to your major
Grade of "C" or above in MATH 211 & MATH 212
Completion of Engineering Fundamental courses (Calculus I & II, Calculus-based Physics, Chemistry, and introductory engineering courses)



The ECE department works closely with local community colleges to develop transfer articulation agreements so that students who complete pre-engineering associate of science degrees can transfer seamlessly to the MSE major.
