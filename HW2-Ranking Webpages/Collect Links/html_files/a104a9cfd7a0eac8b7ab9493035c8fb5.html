About this Program

The English General Minor consists of five (15 credit hours) of 300- and 400-level English courses; however, three hours must be at the 400 level. The General Minor allows students to “make their own” minor and enroll in courses which suit their personal interests and/or professional goals.




Program Highlights


Design your own minor to suit your professional goals or personal interests


Market yourself as a “well-rounded” candidate for future career options


A general minor can mix and match five classes in the five concentration areas: Literature, Professional Writing, Applied Language Studies, Journalism, and Creative Writing. Regardless of emphasis, the curriculum is still noted as a Minor in English.
