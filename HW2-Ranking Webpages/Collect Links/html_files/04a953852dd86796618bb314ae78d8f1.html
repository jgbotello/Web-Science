Student Conduct & Academic Integrity










The Office of Student Conduct & Academic Integrity (OSCAI) continues to foster a climate of personal and academic integrity that facilitates the success of all University community members. To do so, OSCAI assists students and campus partners with concerns about academic integrity violations, classroom disruption, and any other behavioral misconduct. It is important to remember the Code of Student Conduct applies on and off campus and in a virtual format. To address allegations of misconduct, conduct meetings will occur virtually. OSCAI can be contacted by email, oscai@odu.edu, or by phone, 757-683-3431.
