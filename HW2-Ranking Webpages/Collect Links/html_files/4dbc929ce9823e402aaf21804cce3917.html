TRiO Programs













 













What are TRiO Programs?
TRIO Programs exist to encourage and assist people who are traditionally under-resourced and under-represented in post-secondary education including first generation college students, students from limited income families, and/or students with disabilities. TRIO Programs provide the personal attention, planning and knowledge that help to prepare students for entry to, and completion of college.
Federally funded TRIO Programs were created by the Higher Education Act of 1965 and have been at ODU since 1981. ODU has three of eight TRiO programs that support high school and undergraduate students: Upward Bound, Student Support Services and Ronald E. McNair Postbaccalaureate Achievement Program.
