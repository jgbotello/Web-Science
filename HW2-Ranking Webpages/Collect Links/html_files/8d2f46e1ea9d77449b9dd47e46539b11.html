BIOSIGNALS is part of BIOSTEC, the 18th International Joint Conference on Biomedical Engineering Systems and Technologies. Registration to BIOSIGNALS allows free access to all other BIOSTEC conferences.
BIOSTEC 2025 will be held in conjunction with ICISSP 2025 and  PHOTOPTICS 2025.
Registration to BIOSTEC allows free access to the ICISSP and  PHOTOPTICS conferences (as a non-speaker).




Although the conference is back to the normal mode (i.e., in-person) speakers are allowed to present remotely if unable to travel to the venue (hybrid support).

The purpose of the International Conference on Bio-inspired Systems and Signal Processing is to bring together researchers, professionals, and practitioners from multiple areas of expertise working at the intersection of engineering, mathematics, statistics, computer science, data science, biology, physics, and medicine, interested in developing,  applying, and testing algorithmic tools, models, and techniques to solve challenging problems in biology, medicine, and sport. A diversity of signal types can be found in this area, including mechanic, thermal, electric, magnetic, electromagnetic ones, and any other biological sources of information. Since analysing and using the different types of data related to these applications often requires cross-disciplinary expertise, skills, and collaborative efforts, this conference was created with the aim to be a high-quality forum to celebrate many of these ongoing interactions and research efforts.
