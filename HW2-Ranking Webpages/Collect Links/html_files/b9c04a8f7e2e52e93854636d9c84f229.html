 Newly Admitted Transfer Student Appointment





Advisors in the College of Arts and Letters assist students in meeting and embracing the challenges of academic life. Primarily, our advising office in Batten Arts & Letters (BAL), Room 1006, serves freshmen (with the exception of Art and Music students) and new transfer students who plan to pursue majors in the College of Arts and Letters. Students who are majoring in any area of visual arts or music are advised by their departmental advisors from freshman year throughout their college careers at ODU.
Our office serves as first contact for transfer students entering the College of Arts & Letters. Entering transfer students have their very first advising conference with our transfer advisor, after which they are referred to their departmental advisors.
As an ODU student, you are required to have a minimum of one advising conference per semester. This is to help ensure that you are on track and progressing toward your desired degree in a timely manner. We offer information and assistance, often in the form of referrals, to help you stay on track and to assist you in making the decisions and taking the steps that will help you attain your career goals. Our office in BAL includes career management personnel who can address specific issues regarding career preparation. (This career assistance is available to students at all levels of their academic careers and in all Arts & Letters disciplines.)
Keep in mind that, although you have only one required conference per semester, we are available as needed. If you have a quick question or concern, feel free to contact us via email or telephone, or stop by our office for a quick chat. If you need an appointment, we're happy to schedule one that does not interfere with your class schedule.
We look forward to helping you realize your dreams!
