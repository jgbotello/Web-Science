About this Program

The graduate certificate in Arts & Entrepreneurship focuses on helping students cultivate tools that are essential to launching and sustaining successful for-profit, non-profit, and community-based arts programs and initiatives that place art at the forefront of social innovation. These tools include creating sustainable business plans, grant writing, fundraising, social media marketing, cultivating and engaging stakeholders, arts administration, and social entrepreneurial and design thinking skills.  These skills are paired with critical tools drawn from studying the social, political, economic and cultural value of arts-based innovations. The certificate is intended for individuals interested in studio and/or the performing arts, including painting, sculpture, metalwork, graphic design, cartooning, illustration, letterpress, music, dance, theatre, film and video.




Program Highlights


The program focuses on generating entrepreneurial solutions that solve seemingly intractable problems in the Arts. In particular, students are encouraged to address problems of equity and finance.
