        WCS 321
            



Human Rights and World Literature and Cultures





Struggles for human rights and social justice often find their most evocative expression in literary works from around the world. In this course, students will work toward an understanding of different cultural perspectives that inform world concepts of human rights. We will focus on novels, short stories, and poetry. We will also consider the fundamental value of these artistic expressions as both spaces of empathy and agents of change in society. As we discover texts from around the world we will also delve into important socio-political contexts that inform each work. Lastly, this course will turn the lens toward the reader's own values and ideas, and inspire a reconsideration of our place in this world. Prerequisite: A grade of C or better in ENGL 110C.
