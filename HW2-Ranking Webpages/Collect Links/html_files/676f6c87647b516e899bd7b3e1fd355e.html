About this Program

The Certificate in Digital Forensics will educate students in the foundations of digital forensics and its application in the criminal justice system and in corporate investigations. According to the National Institute of Science and Technology, digital forensics is the application of science to the process of identification, collection, examination, and analysis of data stored in computers, while preserving the integrity of the information and maintaining a strict chain of custody. Students will learn how to handle and manage digital evidence (e.g., data stored on a person’s hard drive or cell phone) from discovery to preservation using technologies such as forensic software or a hex editor. Graduates will thus receive a foundation that will enable them to identify, collect, examine, and analyze digital evidence and present their findings as effective witnesses in civil and criminal court cases.




Program Highlights


Full-time, part-time, and non-degree students may enroll in the certificate program and may complete requirements in as little as one year.


Law enforcement professionals, cybersecurity professionals, and students in bachelor’s degree programs in cybersecurity, cyber operations, criminal justice, and interdisciplinary studies (cybercrime major) may find this certification highly desirable in pursuing their career options.
