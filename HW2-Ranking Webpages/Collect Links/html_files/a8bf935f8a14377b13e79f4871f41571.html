About this Program

The Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers a four-year undergraduate program leading to the Bachelor of Science Degree in Civil Engineering (BSCE). The undergraduate degree in civil engineering prepares graduates for entry into professional practice and continued intellectual and professional development throughout their career. Civil engineers conceive, plan, design construct, and maintain the facilities and infrastructures that are essential to our civilization. These include highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, dams, water distribution systems, water and wastewater treatment facilities, industrial and commercial buildings, ports and harbors, coastal and off-shore structures, space satellites and launching facilities. A career in Civil Engineering is suited to you if you are interested in math and science, enjoy turning ideas into reality, have a social awareness and willingness to help people live better, and want personal fulfillment and financial growth.




Program Highlights


The degree program is accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET
