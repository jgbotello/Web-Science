About this Program

This interdisciplinary minor is focused on the exploration of child rights within and across diverse disciplines and in the U.S. and internationally. This perspective challenges approaches in the various disciplines that have in their study of children traditionally denied or failed to recognize children’s human rights and dignity. In place of the traditional perspectives, courses in this interdisciplinary minor frame the study of children within the larger framework of human rights, more specifically, children’s rights and status as a group within society in social science research and theory, literature, the arts, humanities, education, counseling, law and public policy.
