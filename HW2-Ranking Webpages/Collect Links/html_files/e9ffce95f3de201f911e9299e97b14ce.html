Our deep Slack integration to make giving recognition simple and fast!CommunicationsDon't take our word for it, see what our customers sayâWith all the complications and disruptions to our daily routines due to COVID 19 in 2020, Assembly was a key part of continuing employee engagement throughout these difficult times. We are approaching the end of our first year with Assembly and looking forward to continuing the partnership into 2021.âShannon TownsendSales Execution Manager at Coca-ColaâWeâve been honestly surprised at the positive impact Assembly made in team camaraderie. The unique insight into who is positively impacting their colleagues and ultimately the company has been invaluable!âFarbod ShorakaCEO at Promenade Group, Inc.âAssembly has been like a âsnowball rolling down a hillâ for fostering engagement across our teams. One person sharing recognition is a catalyst for multiple team members to take a moment to recognize their coworkers contributions. That simple act of reacting to a shoutout then inspires those individuals to shoutout someone else, and all of a sudden you have a series of shoutouts flowing in.âAdam LewisCEO & Founder at ApploiâWe were looking for a way to recognize employees that was fun, easy to use, and fit our budget. Thereâs always a lot happening. We wanted a recognition program that employees could access on the fly and in the moment, and could be tied to tangible rewards.âMallory YohannanHead of People at HelloTechResource CenterStay up-to-date on Assembly and employee recognition and engagement news, trends, data, and more!Go to Resource CenterEngagement and RecognitionRecognizing Excellence in the Workplace with Teamwork AwardsLearn about the impact of Teamwork Awards, how they can shape your organizationâs culture, and how to use awards effectively.Jonathan FieldsMay 14, 2024Engagement and RecognitionSignificance of Recognizing Employees & Recognition AwardsDive into the transformative power of recognition awards in fostering employee engagement and driving organizational growth.Jonathan FieldsMay 8, 2024Engagement and RecognitionTop Performer Award: Celebrating the Pinnacle of AchievementExplore the value and impact of the Top Performer Award and how to use it to improve productivity in your workplace.Katya HillMarch 25, 2024Get Started for freeReady to invest in a Digital HQÂ and have everything you need to get started?
