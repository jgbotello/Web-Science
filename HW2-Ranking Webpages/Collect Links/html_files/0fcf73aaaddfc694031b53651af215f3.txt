About this Program

The undergraduate curriculum is based on a two-semester foundations course and core courses that provide a well-rounded introduction to the major concentrations of biology. concentration allows a student to focus on a particular area within biology. Many of our students tailor their undergraduate degrees for entry into professional and graduate schools. The department has an excellent program in secondary science education for those desiring to teach, an outstanding pre-health track for students interested in the medical professions, and the combination of academic and research opportunities necessary to best prepare students for research-based graduate studies.




Program Highlights


Utilizing the rich natural and human resources of South Hampton Roads including diverse ecological communities and a major biomedical and research complex, faculty are committed educators.


Department facilities include the striking new Kaplan Orchid Conservatory, electron microscopes, state-of-the-art DNA facilities, and comprehensive analytical and field instruments.


We own the 320 acre Blackwater Ecologic Preserve, part of the Zuni Pine Barrens State Natural Area and our students have access to a rich array of state and federal preserves including the Great Dismal Swamp Wildlife Refuge, Virginia Barrier Islands, Chesapeake Bay, and Back Bay.

Biology for Nonscience Majors II





An introductory biology course for nonbiology majors. This course concentrates on plants and animals at the organismal level by examining major biological concepts involving diversity, ecology, behavior, and evolution. This course would be beneficial to those students who are pursuing elementary education degrees because it teaches biological topics included in the Virginia Standards of Learning. Cannot be substituted for BIOL 121N and BIOL 122N or for BIOL 123N and BIOL 124N.
