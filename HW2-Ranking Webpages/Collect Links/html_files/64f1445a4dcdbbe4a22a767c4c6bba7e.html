TESTIMONIALS




    I am since 1999 involved in the organisation of international conferences among which ICEIS, WEBIST and ICSOFT. We have always had a fruitful cooperation with INSTICC/ SCITEVENTS to the success of our scientific events. Working with SCITEVENTS is always a pleasure. They are incredibly professional and excellent to work with and their events really do a lot for the reputation of our school. We have been working with them since 2003 and are happy to announce that we will also be organizing several conferences together in 2013 (ICEIS, http://www.iceis.org/) and 2014 (BIOSTEC, http://www.biostec.org/)
