Advising













Welcome to the College of Sciences!

In the College of Sciences, our advisors are here to help you make your academic journey at ODU an unforgettable experience that will launch you into the world, resilient and ready to make your mark.
We believe advising is not just about removing holds and helping students decide which courses to take. We work to empower students to make their own decisions, know their options, become independent learners, discover their talents and weaknesses, and learn how to overcome academic challenges. Allow us to help you make the most out of your college experience, both inside and outside of the classroom.
We've seen that a successful college student is one who stays connected to their family as well as the campus community, which is why we highly recommend that you get to know your advisors and professors on a one-on­-one basis.

Stop by the Advising Center in Mills Godwin Building (MGB) 236 to introduce yourself anytime! It's a one-stop-shop to find academic support, career advising, and other campus resources. We look forward to meeting you! Contact us with any questions!
