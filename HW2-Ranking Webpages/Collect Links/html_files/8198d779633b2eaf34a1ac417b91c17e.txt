Curriculum Development Principles and Practices in Elementary Schools





This course will engage students in the on-going debates about the development and shaping of curricula with an emphasis on how these forces play out in elementary schools. The course requires students to investigate the scope and components of curriculum planning, development, and delivery. Students are first expected to develop an understanding of the many forms of dynamic tension at play in curriculum debates, and, subsequently, they are required to develop an understanding of specific ways in which teachers and curriculum leaders can shape the instructional process, and select and use curriculum materials.
