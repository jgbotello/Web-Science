Outstanding Graduate Teaching Assistant Awards
 Old Dominion has recognized graduate teaching assistants who have demonstrated exceptional instructional quality since 1996. Each year, the University selects two outstanding graduate teaching assistants - one for laboratory instruction and one for classroom instruction. The outstanding graduate teaching assistants who are selected are awarded $1,000 and they are recognized at the spring faculty recognition dinner. The College may nominate one student in each category. All of the college nominees receive recognition certificates. Calls for nominations will be sent by the Graduate School and/or the Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies in the spring term.

Excellence in Graduate Teaching Award
Each year, one outstanding tenured faculty member will be recognized by the Office of Academic Affairs for excellence in graduate teaching. Each college may nominate two faculty members. The recipient of this award will receive $2,500 and be recognized at the Annual Faculty Recognition and Awards Ceremony in conjunction with other University -wide awards. Also the recipient's name will be prominently displayed on a plaque in a centralized location.

The Charles O. and Elizabeth C. Burgess Award for Faculty Research and Creativity
The Burgess Award recognizes consistent, high-quality achievement in scholarly or artistic endeavors over a period of years (rather than for a single work). The recipient will have a demonstrably national or international reputation as indicated by recognized experts in the appropriate field. The selection committee will give special consideration to work that results in creative thinking on the nature of assumptions in a given discipline; that represents creative interdisciplinary study; or that creates new forms of visual or performing art. The committee also will give special consideration to those faculty who have been at the University for a significant period of time. No person may receive the award more than once. Calls for nominations will be sent by the Graduate School and/or the Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Studies in the spring term.
