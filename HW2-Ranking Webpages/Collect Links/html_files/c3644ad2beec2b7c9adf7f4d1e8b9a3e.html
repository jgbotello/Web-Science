Class of 2023: Three Siblings From Yemen to Graduate on Same Day 


April 18,  2023








































                            One of the primary reasons I got hired was because of the courses that I took at ODU. My company's CTO was impressed with what I had learned during grad school and also my academic projects.
      
              

Prasanna Sajjan
Master of Science, May 2016

























                            ODU and their CS program have been instrumental to my professional success, preparing me to not only thrive at a company like IBM but also to enter the workforce on an equal footing with seasoned professionals. 
      
              

Christopher Bliss
Operations Manager, IBM, B.S.C.S.

























                            The ODU CS program applies real-world development practices and not just theory-based, which prepares students in many ways for a successful career.
