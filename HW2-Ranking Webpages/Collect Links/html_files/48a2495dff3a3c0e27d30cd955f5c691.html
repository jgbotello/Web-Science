Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Educational Psychology & Program Evaluation at ODU?
Students entering the Doctor of Philosophy program in Educational Psychology & Program Evaluation should meet the minimum university admission requirements Graduate Admission.


There are two paths for admission into the EPPE Program: entrance with a Masters' degree and entrance with a Bachelor's degree. Prospective students seeking admission to the Ph.D. in Education with a Concentration in Educational Psychology and Program Evaluation should submit an application that meets the following guidelines:

Submit transcripts from all colleges and universities previously attended.
Complete and submit an online application. There is a non-refundable application fee for applications to any ODU graduate program.
Complete a Statement of Purpose essay that discusses evidence of your motivation, competence, and potential as a graduate student/scholar. Address why you fit the program, which faculty you would like to work with and why, as well as how the program will help in your career goals. You may also clarify aspects of your academic record, if needed, in the statement of purpose (e.g., a hardship you faced that led to poor performance in a semester).
Submit three letters of recommendation from professional sources capable of commenting on your readiness for advanced graduate study. It is advisable to have at least one letter from a current or former professor you've taken a class with or worked with.
Submit a scholarly writing sample that showcases your verbal and analytical skills/potential. The writing sample may also demonstrate your quantitative skills/potential. Examples include a course paper, technical report, conference paper, journal article, or thesis. If you do not have a scholarly paper to submit or think that you could submit a higher quality original writing sample, we can provide a prompt for you to respond to for the writing sample.
We encourage applicants whose native language is not English to apply. Applicants whose native language is not English may need to submit a current score for the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). More information on the English Proficiency Requirement can be found here: https://www.odu.edu/admission/proficiency
Selected applications will be asked to participate in a 30-minute phone interview with program faculty to discuss your goals, qualifications, and interest in the program.
GRE scores are optional. We are interested in your verbal, quantitative, and analytical skills/potential. GRE scores may be one means of demonstrating aptitude and potential in these areas for some applicants. If you do not submit your GRE scores, we will look for evidence of your aptitudes and potential in your transcripts, statement of purpose, letters of recommendation, writing samples, and in the interview.
EPPE is committed to social justice and equity. We encourage submissions from diverse applicants. That is, we encourage diversity in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, class, disability, and age, among others.
We have a priority deadline of February 1 for fall admission; however, applications are accepted year-round, and students may start the program year-round.
