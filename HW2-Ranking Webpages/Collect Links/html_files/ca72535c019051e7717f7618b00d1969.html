FAQs: Your Online Degree Program



There are a lot of options for earning a college degree online, and they’re all different. You're bound to have questions.Here are some of the most common questions we receive from people considering our degree programs.

Will it be easier to take classes online?Attending college classes online may be more convenient, but don’t confuse that with ease of the online degree programs themselves. Every ODUGlobal class offers the same academic rigor, same instructors, and often the same curriculum as an on-campus class. You’ll benefit from class discussions, group projects, and, depending on your program, even labs.Are online degree programs less impressive than traditional bachelor's degrees?You won’t be earning an “online degree” on your diploma with ODUGlobal. Your degree is no different than our on-campus programs; you'll earn your bachelor’s degree from Old Dominion University. Don't forget that completing an online degree program proves a wide range of skills that may set you apart from your peers including self-discipline, technical savvy, focus, and determination. If asked about your education, be sure to emphasize what you learned and how, and tell your employer why you picked ODU. Will I miss out on the college experience with an online degree program?We talk to graduates who have made lifelong friends with their classmates all over the world. When you work with other people on lessons that matter and will benefit you in the future and in your career, you’re bound to form a connection. Plus, you’ll make connections with faculty who can provide guidance in your academic journey and act as future references. Will my online course credits be eligible for transfer to another program or qualify me for grad school?Because every class you take with ODUGlobal is the same as a class offered on our main campus in Norfolk, Virginia, you’ll be able to present your credits for transfer the same way. There’s no difference! It depends on the program’s requirements, but many of our graduates from online programs have gone on to doctorate programs at other schools as well as with ODU. The sky is the limit!Ready to get started? Contact us today.
