About this Program

The graduate certificate in Health & the Humanities helps students cultivate inter-professional tools that are essential to engaging diverse populations about health and wellness. These tools include interpersonal and mediated health communication strategies, bioethics and decision-making, social and cultural considerations when working with patients, addressing the impact of environmental and socio-economic factors on health and wellness, and integrating arts-based wellness programs into treatment strategies.




Program Highlights


The program focuses on generating entrepreneurial solutions that solve seemingly intractable problems in the health and health administration. In particular, students are encouraged to address problems of access and equitable health outcomes.
