        SPAN 322
            



Identities and Cultures of the Hispanic World





This course examines historical and cultural identities in Spain and Latin America, beginning with a study of the historical constructs that helped create the basis of Spanish and Latin American identities. These include the concept of Convivencia (co-existence) of the three religions in Medieval Spain, pre-Columbian civilizations, the Spanish Conquest, the Colonial period, and the fight for Independence. The course also addresses more modern notions of culture and identity by focusing on themes such as globalization, immigration, economic crises, political leadership, and daily life. Along with these themes, popular culture will be discussed at length in order to understand the role it plays in generating identities. Prerequisites: SPAN 311 and SPAN 312W with a grade of C or better.
