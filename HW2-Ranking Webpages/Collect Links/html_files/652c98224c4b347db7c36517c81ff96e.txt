Effective Interventions for Children and Youth with Challenging Behavior





Students with challenging behavior pose a tremendous challenge to school personnel. Along with the growing incidence of behavior problems, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of research-supported interventions. Emphasis is on assessment of the structural and functional properties of problem behavior to facilitate development of interventions that match the nature and severity of the problem behavior. The course focuses on gaining knowledge of the likely source(s) of challenging behavior, including various strategies to document the environmental determinants of the behavior, establishment of school-wide, classroom-level, and student-specific intervention programs and ways to document the outcome of those interventions. Attention is given to adult- as well as peer-mediated intervention options for problem behavior reduction/replacement among children and youth from diverse backgrounds and across categories of exceptionality. Practicum of 45 hours required. Prerequisites: SPED 400/SPED 500, SPED 411/SPED 511, and passing scores on Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educator Tests or equivalent as prescribed by the Virginia Board of Education.
