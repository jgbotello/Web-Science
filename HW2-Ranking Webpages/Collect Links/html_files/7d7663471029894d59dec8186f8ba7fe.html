About this Program

The Master's program in physics provides an education within experimental and theoretical physics and aims at giving the candidates a broad professional background in physics. The candidate can focus the program towards a variety of topics based on ongoing research activities at the Physics Department.




Program Highlights


Selected by the University to achieve national prominence, taking advantage of Old Dominion’s proximity (a half-hour drive) to the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF), the world’s premier nuclear physics research facility, and the NASA Langley Research Center.


The Physics department has grown tremendously in the past 20 years, with double the number of faculty, new teaching and laboratory facilities and modernized computer-based laboratories.


The addition of the new Physical Sciences Research Building offers substantial opportunities for research to graduate and undergraduate students alike.
