About this Program

The computer engineering program is designed to provide a broad engineering background and a comprehensive foundation in the technical principles underlying the computer area. The technical core consists of coursework from electrical engineering to address hardware aspects of computer engineering and coursework from computer science to address software aspects. The curriculum builds on the hardware description language tools introduced in the sophomore year to master the design, test and synthesis of advanced digital circuits.




Program Highlights


The ECE department has research laboratories focusing on Applied Plasma Technology; Cybersecurity, Communications and Networking Innovation; Microelectronics and Thin Film Devices; Medical Imaging, Diagnosis, and Analysis; Power Research; Systems Analysis of Metabolic Physiology; Systems Research; Virginia Institute for Photovoltaics; and Vision Lab.


ECE faculty support University centers such as the Applied Research Center, the Frank Reidy Center of Bioelectrics, and the Virginia Modeling, Analysis, and Simulation Center.


Additional research facilities in the Hampton Roads area with ECE faculty collaboration include the National Institute of Aerospace, NASA Langley Research Center and Jefferson Lab.

Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Computer Engineering at ODU?
Students entering the Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering program in Computer Engineering should meet the minimum university admission requirements Undergraduate Admission.


The Office of Admissions evaluates and admits freshmen based on high school performance, references and SAT scores. All incoming freshman engineering students are admitted to the Engineering Fundamentals Division


The ECE Department will officially declare a student as a computer engineering student once the following requirements are met:

Completion of 30 credit hours applicable to your major
Grade of "C" or above in MATH 211 & 212
Completion of Engineering Fundamental courses (Calculus I & II, Calculus-based Physics, Chemistry, and introductory engineering courses)



The ECE department works closely with local community colleges to develop transfer articulation agreements so that students who complete pre-engineering associate of science degrees can transfer seamlessly.
