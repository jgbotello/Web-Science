The Alumni Association's premier scholarship is awarded annually to exceptional students who demonstrate outstanding academic achievement. Five recipients are chosen as entering freshmen, and may renew their scholarship for four years if they maintain the required GPA. Thanks to the support received from alumni and community leaders for the ODU Alumni Signature Events including the annual golf tournament, the Monarch Cobia Classic and the annual Alumni Honors Dinner, 36 scholarships are awarded annually.
