Old Dominion University Announces Partnership with GEICO
Mar 04, 2021

Old Dominion University (ODU) is proud to announce they have partnered with GEICO's Virginia Beach office to help associates advance their education, either on campus in Norfolk or online through ODUOnline. Through ODU and GEICO's Team Education Benefits, ODU offers classes approved for career advancement at GEICO, plus select degree programs that are covered by GEICO's employee education benefits.
"Our GEICO office in Virginia Beach is excited to partner with Old Dominion University to remove barriers for our employees to continue to pursue their education," said Beth Roberts, GEICO Director of Human Resources for Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. "We would love to afford every one of our employees the opportunity to achieve a bachelor’s degree and with Old Dominion’s help we can do that together."  

With ODU, GEICO employees can start or complete a bachelor's degree or transfer a business degree from Tidewater Community College for credit at ODU. GEICO associates can also prepare for advancement within their careers by taking approved business courses for management associates and aspiring managers. 
 
"We have found continued success in hiring graduates from Old Dominion," Roberts continued. "We think it is a natural relationship that would benefit all involved.” 
 
The University agrees. "Workforce development has always been a major priority for ODU," said Andy Casiello, Associate Vice President for Distance Learning. "We are so proud to provide our experience in distance learning to help GEICO employees meet their goals."
