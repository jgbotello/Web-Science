About this Program

The Music Minor can be paired with practically any major in the university. The minor areas are designed for students who want to continue to develop musically throughout their college career. It is highly recommended that students begin the Music Minor in the freshman year. The Music History Minor includes the departmental requirements of the degree and history-specific courses such as History of Music and History of Jazz.
