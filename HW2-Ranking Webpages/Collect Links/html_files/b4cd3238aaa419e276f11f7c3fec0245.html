About this Program

The minor in political science is designed to support students interested in strengthening their understanding of politics, government, and public policy.

The minor is also valuable preparation for students who want to engage the future as informed citizens.

The minor is focused generally on politics and government.


Students have the opportunity to enroll in domestic and international politics courses.
