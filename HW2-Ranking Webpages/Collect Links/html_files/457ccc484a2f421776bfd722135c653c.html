About this Program

In this rapidly changing and increasingly competitive technological world, graduate degrees are highly desirable and most often master’s degrees are required to hold higher-level professional environmental engineering positions in the industry, and in federal, state and municipal government agencies. The department’s graduate programs are designed to educate the technological leaders of the future in environmental engineering, and are structured to accommodate both full-time and part-time students. The specialty areas in environmental engineering include water quality, water and wastewater treatment, hydrologic processes, water resources, environmental engineering microbiology, air quality, hazardous and solid waste, biofuels, nutrient cycling, and pollution prevention. A distance learning master’s degree programs in Environmental Engineering is also available.




Program Highlights


For the MS program, there are three options; Thesis option with 24 credit hours of coursework and a six credit hour thesis, Project option with 27 credit hours of coursework and a three-credit hour research project, and Course option with 30 credit hours of coursework and a final comprehension examination.

Requirements
What are the requirements to apply for Environmental Engineering (M.S.) at ODU?
Students entering the Master of Science program in Environmental Engineering (M.S.) should meet the minimum university admission requirements Graduate Admission.


Environmental Engineering master's degree applicants must have a bachelor’s degree, preferably, in civil or environmental engineering with a strong background in mathematics and physical sciences. Each applicant must submit an essay of 500 words or less describing personal and academic goals, professional objectives, preparation for graduate study, and how the chosen program will help the applicant achieve these goals and objectives. Two letters of recommendation must be submitted from former or current professors, or employment supervisors.  Provisional admission may also be possible for applicants with a bachelor’s degree in a field other than the applicant’s intended graduate program. In such cases there will be pre-requisite course requirements. Provisional admission may be given to those applicants who do not hold a bachelor’s degree in civil or environmental engineering; however, these students will be required to complete undergraduate coursework in addition to the graduate program requirements.  




More Program and Degree Requirements





For Admission to the Environmental Engineering (M.S.) Program





        GPA Requirements
            



Regular admission to a master’s degree program generally requires an undergraduate GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale. Applicants with a lower undergraduate GPA may be considered for regular or provisional admission on the basis of successful engineering work experience or other credentials demonstrating potential for success in the graduate program. 








        GRE
            



The submission of Graduate Record Examination (GRE) is required unless the applicant holds an ABET accredited engineering degree from an institution.








        TOEFL
            



TOEFL (or IELTS) is required for all applicants whose native language is not English unless their BS degrees are from USA institutions or countries where English is the primary language of the people.
