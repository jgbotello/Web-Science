About this Program

The minor in Middle Eastern studies focuses on the study of several aspects of Middle Eastern culture, language, politics, geography, and history. The minor consists of 15 hours of course work. Students can elect Track I which includes as a prerequisite three hours of 202-level Arabic, French, Hebrew, Farsi or any other language used in research in the region; this course is not included in the grade point average for the minor. Languages such as Armenian and Turkish could meet this requirement upon the taking of a proficiency examination. Students can also choose Track II, which is a non-language option.
