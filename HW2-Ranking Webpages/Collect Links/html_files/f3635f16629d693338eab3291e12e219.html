About this Program

This interdisciplinary Minor is for students who would like to learn about energy engineering fundamentals, socio-environmental impacts of energy systems, and novel energy engineering technologies. The Minor will enhance their abilities to integrate knowledge from different disciplines with concepts used in energy engineering and offer the students the opportunity to be recognized for study in this growing interdisciplinary field.




Program Highlights


Expose students to energy engineering fundamentals and a system approach to energy systems and their sociological, economic, and environ-mental impacts


Enhance students’ ability to intergrate knowledge in relation to various energy technologies and primary resource vectors such as fossil, nuclear and renewables


Expose students to novel energy engineering concepts and technologies such as smart grids, integrated generation systems, storage, transmissions and distribution systems


Foster a better understanding of public policies to provide greater momentum to the energy industry
