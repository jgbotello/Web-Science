Hi Jhon BOTELLO MALDONADO,

Resolving GitHub issues remains a significant challenge in software engineering—it’s common to feel stuck in a constant “merge conflict.” Why? Many existing tools struggle with accuracy and accessibility or rely too heavily on proprietary models.

In this competition, you’ll build AI models to tackle a special version of the SWE-Bench benchmark, where your submitted notebooks will be frozen and then evaluated on future Github issues. This will help automate issue resolution and make sure models can’t be overfit on test data. With better tools, engineers can spend less time fixing problems and more on creative work, like designing features and improving user experiences.

Total Prizes:
$1,225,000

Entry Deadline:
March 5, 2025
