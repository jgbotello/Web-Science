Dear Mr. Kaczenski,

 

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to inform you that I have submitted my application for the Risk Modeling and Simulation for Offshore position at Fraunhofer IWES. The opportunity to contribute to your team’s innovative work in offshore decommissioning projects aligns closely with my academic background and professional experience in systems engineering and simulation modeling.

 

Please let me know if you need any additional information or documents to support my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team and would be happy to discuss my qualifications further.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration.

 

Best regards,
