Hi All,

Just a reminder that 2024 is nearly done and we're running out of time to get your 2024 blog posts in.  I know many of you have drafts in progress, but here's what I have so far:

https://ws-dl.cs.odu.edu/wiki/index.php/Blog_Plan#2024_Blog_Posts

Also, attached is the number of views for the top 10 most popular blog posts from the last 7 days.  There are some long-time popular posts ("Wayback Memento", "Flash Games", "Carbon Dating"), but most are pretty recent, esp. Travis's iframe ads post (getting traction with the IA folks) and recent trip reports from Yash and Mohan. 

Trip reports are especially useful: if the taxpayers have funded us to travel on their dime, we owe the public an explanation of how we spent our time and their $.   Even though CS is a conference-driven discipline and there are advantages to traveling, it remains a terribly inefficient method, for both the time it takes and the money it costs, for presenting results.  Not everyone can travel, and there are certainly more events than any one person has time for.  Our commentary about the events we're fortunate enough to attend is helpful to our colleagues that did not travel. 

regards,

Michael
