All, What day will work for you? this week. We want to put an experimental setup together to see what the data collection process will be like, so we can know any challenges that can arise and go about solving them. For the Minerva topic 6. Wednesday and Thursday

Lawrence,
I am sorry I am still not feeling well and will not be able to make it in tomorrow to run through the biometric data collection process for T6-Beyond the clock. 

Does next week work? 

Best,
