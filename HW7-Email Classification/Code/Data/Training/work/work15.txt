Hi, guys.
I sent this in he comments, but just in case you did not see it in the meeting this is how the format would look like with chain of thought:

<output>
    <chain_of_thought>
    The article contains references to several key entities that fit into the specified categories. First, "Afghanistan" is explicitly mentioned as the home country of Atiq Rahimi and is classified as a geographical location. Second, "Atiq Rahimi," the main subject of the article, is a person. Third, "Klassekampen," the source of the article, qualifies as an organization. Lastly, "Zaher Shah," the ex-king of Afghanistan discussed in the article, is categorized as a person. No other explicit entities matching the five categories were found in the text.
    </chain_of_thought>
    <formatted_output>
    [
        {"entity": "Afghanistan", "entity_type": "GEOGRAPHICAL_LOCATION"},
        {"entity": "Atiq Rahimi", "entity_type": "PERSON"},
        {"entity": "Klassekampen", "entity_type": "ORGANIZATION"},
        {"entity": "Zaher Shah", "entity_type": "PERSON"}
    ]
    </formatted_output>
</output>


Regards,
Joseph
