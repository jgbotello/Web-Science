Hey everyone,
Below is my weekly check-in:
Working Days:
Remote: Tuesday, Thursday
What did I learn?
~ Last week, I learned how to use SQLite in a C# application, and it turned out to be much easier than I expected. SQLite is a free, lightweight SQL database that offers simple installation and implementation, making it ideal for projects requiring data persistence. In particular, I found it extremely useful for implementing data permanence in video games made with Unity. For those unfamiliar with SQLite and interested in exploring its capabilities, I recommend checking out guides with examples, such as the official SQLite documentation or Unity-specific tutorials.

What Is SQLite? SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine.SQLite is the most used database engine in the world. SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers and comes bundled inside countless other applications that people use every day.
