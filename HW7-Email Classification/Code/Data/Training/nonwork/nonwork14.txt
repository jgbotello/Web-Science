Hi Jhon,

Do you have a research paper, a thesis, or an insight from your academic work that’s worth sharing? Publish it on Medium!

Professors, researchers, and students use Medium to easily share their ideas with a wider audience. On Medium, our mission is to help people deepen understanding of the world around them; some of the writing that our readers love most comes from academics.

If you have a story to share, we’d love to read it. Learn more about how to get started with our two-part guide: An introduction to academic writing on Medium, and How to publish your academic writing on Medium. It’s got examples of stories, interviews from faculty who use Medium, a quick explainer of how Medium works, and more.

And if you’re already part of our growing community of academic writers, thank you for sharing your wisdom through your writing.

Brittany
Chief of Staff, Medium

P.S., We’re here to help; if you have questions about publishing on Medium, email us at academics@medium.com. If you share your research on Medium, reply to this email to let us know. We’d love to read it!
