Last-Minute Easy and Fun Neighbor Gifts
 
When we celebrated the first Christmas in our new home, we were still getting to know our neighbors. Having come from a rural community where a knock on the door was uncommon, I jumped a little when I heard someone use the antique door knocker on our front door. I remember opening it and being delighted at seeing my neighbor with a beautifully wrapped treat in her hands. She introduced herself to me and wished us all a Merry Christmas! I remember marveling at the beauty of her baked delicacy and the care she had taken to tie a ribbon around it.
Homemade gifts are a wonderful way to show friends and loved ones you care. They take thought and time to put together and are usually inexpensive options for gift-giving. Homemade gifts can make great neighbor gifts as well! Whether you're planning on baking cookies or taking a delicious loaf of bread, I thought I'd share some easy and fun neighbor gift ideas to inspire you this season!
Last-Minute Easy and Fun Neighbor Gifts
Cookie Dough Gift Idea - Jaimielyn Nye, from I Heart Naptime, shares this wonderful idea of frozen cookie dough as a neighbor gift! They can be baked right away or stored in the freezer for later. This would also be a lovely gift to add to a meal you may be taking to a friend in need. I love the presentation as well!
Seasonal Dish Soap with Tea Towel - I always appreciate simple and practical gift ideas. I love a delightful seasonal soap to make daily chores more enjoyable. A gift like this doesn't add any extra clutter and is something that can be enjoyed even after the holidays are over.
Simmer Pot Gift Idea - There's something comforting and delightful about the fragrance of orange, rosemary, cinnamon, and clove! Mindy, from Coco and Ash, shares where to buy everything you need to make a simmer pot gift bag. In addition, she provides a free cute printable to dress up your simmer pot for the holidays and provides instructions.
Christmas Morning Pancakes - Give the gift of breakfast! This would also make a wonderful addition to any meal you are taking. All the dry ingredients for pancakes are premixed and ready to use with the addition of an egg and 1 cup of milk!

Cinnamon Honey Butter - If you love baking bread, consider gifting your next loaf with this delicious cinnamon honey butter. To dress your jar up as a gift, add a touch of festive greenery and twine around the lid!

Crock-Pot Applesauce - We often think of apples for fall, but it is a flavor appropriate for Christmas as well! Adina shares in her blog the easiest way to make applesauce using a crock-pot! If you're looking to dress up your basic applesauce recipe, I love this one as well.

Hot Cocoa Kit - As the temperatures drop I appreciate a warm drink more and more. This is a wonderful idea and can be completely customizable. Want to make individual sizes for every member of your neighbor's family? Use these jars here. Looking to make a dairy-free hot cocoa kit? Use oat milk powder and dairy-free chocolate chips instead! Be sure to download the adorable hot cocoa instructions tag listed in the post! Baker's twine can be found at the Dollar Tree.
