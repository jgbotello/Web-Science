# Web Science 
The Web has fundamentally transformed how we learn, play, communicate and work. Its impact has been so great that it has given rise to a new science: Web Science, or the science of decentralized information structures. Although Web Science is inherently interdisciplinary.  Specifically, it provides an overview of the World Wide Web and associated decentralized information structures, with a primary focus on the computational aspects of the Web: how it works, how it is used, and how it can be analyzed. 

This repository is intended to solve the assignments associated with the course as part of my learning.
