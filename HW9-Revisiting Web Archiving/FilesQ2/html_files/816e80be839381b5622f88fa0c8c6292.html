            The Writing Center
          


 
The Writing Center provides supplemental instruction to help students improve their writing strategies. Instead of providing a proofreading service, we offer tutoring sessions that assist students in learning to proofread their own work, in getting projects started, and in developing the writing process for a paper.
The Writing Center offers 45-minute appointments with graduate student tutors who work with individual students or with groups. Most tutoring sessions are by appointment; walk-in appointments are provided when tutors are not in a scheduled session. For distance students, we use WCOnline for online appointments. Students have the option of making standing appointments with tutors once per week for up to four weeks at a time and may have up to three appointments per week. In addition to tutoring services for undergraduate and graduate students, we will visit classrooms to provide writing lessons and group tutorials. Visit the website>>

            Language Learning Center
          


 
The Language Learning Center serves the needs of faculty, students and the Hampton Roads community in promoting the study of foreign languages offered at Old Dominion University through the use of technology enhanced methods and materials. The Center has been an integral part of the World Languages and Cultures Department in the College of Arts and Letters since its inception in 1992 and serves over 1,200 students each semester.
