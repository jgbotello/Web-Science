How to Ride
Get the information you need to reach your destination, including bus route(s), departure and arrival times, and fare information by either:Calling RIPTA´s information at line 401-781-9400Picking up a bus at one of RIPTA’s major transit hubs.Using the Trip Planner on the RIPTA.com homepageOnce you know when your bus will arrive, look for one of our designated bus stops marked with the RIPTA logo. Be sure to be at the stop at least 5 minutes before your bus is scheduled to arrive.Watch for your bus. When the bus approaches, first look at the destination sign (located above the windshield) for a route number and name. If this is your bus, it should have the same number and route name as listed on your schedule. If you are unsure, ask the bus driver if he or she is going to your destination.Have your cash fare or passes and any other required identification ready before you board. Use the handrails to safely board the bus.Pay your fare with Wave or by placing your money in the farebox as you get on the bus. If your bus pass has a photo identification on it, be prepared to show it to the driver.  RIPTA drivers and fareboxes do not make change.Take a seat, relax, and watch for your destination stop. Follow RIPTA rules of riding refraining from smoking, eating, drinking, radio playing, or activities that are offensive to the other passengers.About one block before you want to get off, signal the driver by pulling the overhead cord once to ring the bell and turn on the “Request to Stop” light. When exiting the bus, make sure the bus comes to a complete stop and the doors are fully opened before getting off.
Follow these steps for a safe, comfortable, and easy ride to your destination!
