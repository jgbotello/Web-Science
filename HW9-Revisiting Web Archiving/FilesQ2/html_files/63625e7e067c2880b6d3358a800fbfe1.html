Office of Counseling Services










Need Urgent/Crisis Support? Visit Emergencies.












Although our office name is Counseling Services, we provide more than our name implies. We offer free and confidential mental health care to registered students, including individual and group counseling, psychiatric services, crisis intervention, and a variety of outreaches and workshops. It is our mission to foster a culture of care, emphasizing better mental health and well-being. We are devoted to helping students resolve stressful circumstances in their lives and equipping you with the tools for a healthy work-life balance so you may reach your personal and academic goals.
The Office of Counseling Services also hosts the Meditation Room, a quiet space for students to practice mindfulness and meditation. Thirty minute sessions in the room can be booked through the Monarch Wellness Portal.
Our services are offered in an atmosphere that is welcoming and respectful of all students regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, citizenship, or physical status.
Our staff is committed to your success and we look forward to partnering with you to make your college years a satisfying experience.
