            How Accreditation Works:
          


Accreditation signifies Old Dominion University's success in meeting its mission and achieving its objectives and goals.
The process for initial and continued accreditation involves:

A collective analysis and judgment by the institution's internal constituencies.
An informed review by peers external to the institution.
A reasoned decision by the elected members of the accreditor.

Accredited institutions periodically conduct internal reviews involving their administrative officers, staff, faculties, students, trustees, and others appropriate to the process.
The internal review allows an institution to:

Consider its effectiveness in achieving its stated mission.
Re-evaluate its compliance with the accreditation's requirements.
its efforts in enhancing the quality of student learning and the quality of programs and services offered to its constituents.

At the culmination of the internal review, peer evaluators representing the accreditor apply their professional judgment through a preliminary assessment of the institution; elected Board Members make the final determination of an institution's compliance with the accreditation requirements.
