Academic Advising










At ODU we use professional advisors and faculty advisors to support our diverse student population. We encourage all degree-seeking students to meet with their academic advisor at least once per semester to make sure they are on track to meet their academic goals. Your advisor is excited to meet with you to discuss academic and career goals, course scheduling, opportunities around campus, as well as resources for your academic success.
Professional advisors are available year-round to assist students and can meet as often as you would like! You can find the name and contact information of your advisor on your myODU portal, or you can email the advising office associated with your major using the “Find your Advisor” page on the right-hand side of this website.













With over 120 undergraduate programs, 130 graduate programs at the master's, education specialist and doctoral levels plus a wealth of certificate and professional development programs, Old Dominion University has the program for you.

Listing of Graduate Program Directors for all schools and colleges at Old Dominion University.


Graduate Program Directors























The Office of Advising Administration guides undergraduate students through academic challenges and choices, oversees the administration of professional advising for ODU’s main campus, and partners with students to support them in achieving their educational goals.
Our office is located in the Student Success Center. You may contact the office at (757) 683-3699 or advisor@odu.edu.
We encourage all degree-seeking students to be advised prior to registering each semester to ensure they are taking classes that align with their academic plan and plans for graduation. If you have an advisor degree-plan hold preventing you from registering for classes, you must meet with your academic adviser who can remove the hold.
