What Others Are Saying











Katie engaged my children, made them feel capable, smart and understood.  She taught them strategies to use for the rest of their lives. After each hour of working with Katie, both of my high schoolers would leave inspired, motivated and happy…about schoolwork! She is a magician.  She specializes in students with executive functioning challenges and is so passionate about their success.Amie, parent







Before meeting Katie, our son struggled with anxiety and found school a constant battle. When he started working with Katie and was given the tools and strategies to work within his areas of weakness, he truly began to thrive. From planning and organization to time management and task initiation, Katie has helped him develop a wide range of essential skills.Not only has Katie helped our son overcome his challenges, but she has also instilled a sense of pride and confidence in him.Carolyn,  parent







Katie Azevedo with SchoolHabits has been instrumental in my son’s academic success. Her expertise has developed his study skills, improved his writing, enhanced his time management and prepared him for academics during and beyond high school. During that time my son has learned how to prioritize workload and minimize procrastination. As a parent, I would highly recommend SchoolHabits to anyone.Melissa, parent







Katie has been my tutor for multiple years, helping me with anything from SAT/AP test prep to college/internship applications. She is always positive and kind, creating a happy and comfortable workspace. Her passion for making every student successful is very evident and is what makes her the best tutor!Caroline, student 







Our daughter had a wonderful experience working with Katie. We saw a significant improvement in her writing skills, her ability to focus and process test questions, and her overall approach to learning. These improved skills translated to higher standardized test scores, school grades, and very well-written college essays. Equally important, our daughter looked forward to every session, as Katie made learning fun. Julie, parent







Katie has a gift for zeroing in on what’s causing a student to struggle. She then teaches effective strategies for overcoming the specific obstacles hindering that student from reaching his fullest potential. My son has become more confident after working with Katie and is now a straight-A student. He knows what type of learner he is and how to tackle note-taking, studying, reading, essay writing, and other assignments or academic tasks in a way that best suits his individual learning style. In a way, Katie’s given my son a map of his mind and how it works. He can now maneuver through tasks more effectively because she’s helped him understand himself.  I highly recommend her.Min, parent







Katie’s approach and methods to active reading, analyzing text, and writing fundamentally changed and improved my daughter’s critical thinking skills and her writing style. Her essay writing improved dramatically and she became a more confident and insightful writer. Katie even helped spark a love of reading that my daughter had lost in her middle school years.Jo, parent
