            A Message From President Hemphill
      












President Brian O. Hemphill, Ph.D.

Through embracing a culture of innovation, I am pleased to share the incredible work of our dedicated campus in charting a clear course for the future engagement and success of Old Dominion University. This bold plan is truly a reflection of our students, faculty, staff, alumni, and friends, who have a lasting legacy of making a significant difference on our campus, in the community, across the Commonwealth, and beyond!
For more than a year, campus stakeholders engaged in a comprehensive process to develop a five-year strategic plan, thereby determining both the short-term focus and long-term success of our institution, which – above all else – will be dedicated to students. With nearly 300 individuals serving on a total of 12 groups, 30 goals and 103 strategies were carefully developed across seven focal areas.
The title, “Forward-Focused: Where Innovation Meets Possibilities,” is a direct reflection of the bold and innovative goals and strategies that were brought forth by those directly involved in thinking and rethinking the future of our great institution. As this important work has generated great excitement and opportunity for Monarchs, the future has boundless possibilities!
With Monarch Pride,​
Brian O. Hemphill, Ph.D.
President
