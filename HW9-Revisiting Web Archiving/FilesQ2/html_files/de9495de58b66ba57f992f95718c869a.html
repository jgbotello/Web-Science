            Program Highlights
          


Program for Undergraduate Research and Scholarship (PURS)
 
The Old Dominion University Office of Undergraduate Research, part of the Division of Research and Economic Development, offers grants to support one-year pilot projects in research and other creative work activities. These projects are designed to provide undergraduate students with authentic research and creative activity experiences as a primary objective. Eligible applicants include research faculty, tenured faculty, and tenure-track faculty.
For the next 2025-2026 academic year, this program will evolve into a more robust initiative aligned with the new offerings planned by the Office of Undergraduate Research. Stay tuned for updates on these initiatives and the upcoming launch of the new “PURS” program.

Questions should be directed to Orlando Ayala, PhD (oayala@odu.edu).
The deadline for PURS is January 31, 2025.

Summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates
 
The Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program supports active research participation by undergraduate students in any of the areas of research funded by the National Science Foundation. REU projects involve students in meaningful ways in ongoing research programs or in research projects specifically designed for the REU program.
