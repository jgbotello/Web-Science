VMSDEP Award Information
As a state veterans’ benefit, the VMSDEP will be included as a financial resource in your financial aid package and may reduce state grants*, university grants or scholarships, federal loans, federal work-study, and private loans. Each financial aid offer type is different, so the benefit may affect each person's offer differently.
*A student cannot receive both VMSDEP and state grants. The state grant award will be cancelled once the student is authorized for VMSDEP.
Tuition benefits (Tier 1 and Tier 2) 
Eligible students, as confirmed by DVS, are guaranteed a waiver of all tuition and mandatory fees for eight semesters at a Virginia public college or university and Eastern Virginia Medical School. Please note tuition and mandatory fees are waived.
Housing, dining, books, and supplies are considered educational expenses, however, are not considered mandatory fees and are not waived under this program.
Stipend benefits (Tier 2 only)
Eligible students may receive a stipend to offset educational expenses such as housing, dining, books, and supplies. SCHEV works with DVS and the public colleges and universities in disbursing funds. The amount of the stipend is determined annually by SCHEV and is dependent on the student's enrollment status; the number of participating students; and available funding. Stipends are awarded later in the semester when funds are received from SCHEV.
