Office of Intercultural Relations










Our Vision
The Office of Intercultural Relations (OIR) is committed to fostering interculturalization on campus through program initiatives that integrate intercultural learning experiences, embrace global perspectives, and enhance students' sense of belonging, engagement, and success.
Our Mission
The Office of Intercultural Relations (OIR) at Old Dominion University (ODU) is committed to promoting an inclusive and equitable campus community whose members have knowledge of one's own cultural identity and the culture of others. OIR's programs, activities, and events represent unique and engaging cultural experiences and celebrations that cultivate a climate of awareness, understanding, and learning experiences. Intergroup understanding, communication, cultural empathy and humility, critical thinking skills, awareness of structural power relations are achieved through planned initiatives and trainings.
Statement on Diversity and Inclusion
The Division of Student Engagement & Enrollment Services values the uniqueness of our Monarch community. The word "engagement" reflects our commitment to embrace the differences in our cultural backgrounds, perceptions, beliefs, traditions, world views, socio-economic status, cognitive and physical abilities.
We will strive to serve as the pre-eminent model for engaging every student to achieve their own success. Our core values are fueled by our responsibility and actions toward community development and engagement, cultural competence and understanding, physical and mental wellness and inclusion for every member of ODU. We will embrace our greatest strength - the diverse composition of our student body and workforce.
