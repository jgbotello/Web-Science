RISD Policy Library

Welcome to the Policy Library, the site for all institutional policies and their related procedures and forms of Rhode Island School of Design.

The goals of all RISD policies are to


clarify the institution's expectations of its individual members;
increase transparency in our relations with all constituents;
provide management and visibility into areas of risk and compliance;
enhance efficiency;
ensure compliance with laws and regulations, and
guide us in fulfilling our philosophy and reaching our goals as set forth in our mission statement.

The policies and procedures published here supersede any versions published elsewhere in student, faculty or staff handbooks and other formats and locations. All students, faculty, staff, stakeholders, and visitors to RISD are guided by these policies and should be familiar with them.
