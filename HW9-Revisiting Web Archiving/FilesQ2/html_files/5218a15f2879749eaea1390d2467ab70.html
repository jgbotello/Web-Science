Proposed Transit Center











Rhode Islanders deserve a safe, modern transit center with state-of-the-art amenities, and we are committed to making that a reality.
Throughout this project, we will be engaging with riders, advocates, and other stakeholders in a robust public process to collaboratively locate and design this new transit center.


About this Project
We will be constructing a new, modern transit center with state-of-the-art amenities based on feedback from riders and RIPTA drivers.
This new transit center will improve rider safety. It will include adequate lighting, and an emphasis on pedestrian safety. We want to create a transit center that does not require riders to cross many streets. Passengers will be able to transfer in an environment that is safe and controlled. This center will also be interconnected to other transit options, built to minimize transfers and maximize efficiency for riders. It will include a direct link to the Providence Train Station, Kennedy Plaza, the Rhode Island Convention Center, and other high-traffic areas.
