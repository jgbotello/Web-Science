Human Services Transportation Coordination









Human Services Transportation Coordinating Council
Vision
Accessible, coordinated statewide mobility for all Rhode Islanders.
Mission
Promoting independence through enhanced statewide mobility, while fostering collaboration between public, private, and non-profit sector partners by gathering and sharing information, supporting transportation initiatives, and advocating for positive change.
Council Members
The Rhode Island General Assembly directed RIPTA to convene a coordinating council to better integrate transportation programs that support individuals in need of specialized transportation assistance. The following agencies are currently represented on the Council:
RI Dept. of Behavioral Health, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals
RI Dept. of Health
RI Dept. of Human Services
RI Division of Statewide Planning
RI Executive Office of Health & Human Services
RI Office of Healthy Aging
RI Office of Rehabilitative Services
RI Office of Veterans Services
RI Public Transit Authority
RI Dept. of Transportation

Rhode Island’s Human Services Transportation Coordinating Council held its inaugural meeting in January 2018, bringing together representatives of public agencies responsible for meeting the transportation needs of vulnerable populations and community advocates. Throughout the first year, working groups addressed specific challenges and opportunities – initially focusing on identifying sustainable funding for RIPTA’s statewide free bus pass program for low-income seniors and individuals with disabilities and improving communications between agencies that provide transportation assistance. The statewide Council continues to hold public meetings every other month and has started to pursue additional projects such as the development of a customer-focused approach to connecting riders with transportation services.
The Coordinating Council also led the update of the 2023 Public Transit-Human Services Transportation Coordinated Plan, which was adopted in March 2023.
