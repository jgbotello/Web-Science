We have history together. Our region. Our city. Our university. All of us. At Old Dominion University, we are first-generation students, fourth-generation veterans and the next generation of risk-taking entrepreneurs who will invent our own tables instead of waiting for a seat at another's.
Old Dominion University, located in Norfolk, is Virginia's forward-focused public doctoral research university with more than 24,000 students, rigorous academics, an energetic residential community and initiatives that contribute $2.6 billion annually to Virginia's economy.
