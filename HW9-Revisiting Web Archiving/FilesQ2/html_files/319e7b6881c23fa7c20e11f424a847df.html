Some things have gotten better with the app and others, as usual have taken a step backwards. I routinely switched from Canada to the United States and now I have to go back to the homepage to switch over whereas before I could have switched anywhere on the app. It's minor, yes but just one more annoyance on top of the other many minor annoyances. The add a product definitely has gotten better102 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoD Mmore_vert Flag inappropriateNovember 2, 2024Every time I get comfortable with the setup, it gets completely overhauled. Not small tweaks; they’re drastic changes that require relearning the entire layout—like switching the keys on a typewriter just as you get used to typing! Stability and consistency are crucial, even if the design isn't perfect. Our minds adjust better to a familiar, stable setup than to constant overhauls. Who’s managing this? It feels like changes are being made without considering the value of continuity for its users17 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoDorothee Crawfordmore_vert Flag inappropriateShow review historyOctober 31, 2024You get little help in a timely way. You're constantly referred to the website learn how to do it, and then you get to read and read and read. What colossal waste of time. If you send a comment or complaint, you get boilerplate responses the next day or two. Also no help. Update: Amazon gleefully changes seller tools, features, and functions almost weekly. Then of course your former tools are useless, the "new" feature must be learned, thus creating the loss of valuable work time for sellers.23 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNoSee all reviewsWhat’s newWe’re constantly working to enhance your Amazon Seller app experience.
