Thank you for visiting the Center for Faculty Development’s website. Aligned with ODU’s values, the Center encourages a growth mind-set fostering excellence, continuous improvement, and community. Its commitment to excellence is demonstrated through a broad range of programming designed to help faculty excel in teaching, research, and scholarly engagement. The Center promotes high-impact teaching practices, inclusive pedagogies, and mentorship to enhance student success and improve faculty and student sense of belonging. Programming is grounded in evidence-based research with ongoing assessment processes used to guide faculty development. Most importantly, the Center embraces faculty development through a community lens as it brings together a diverse group of scholars committed to excelling in their careers and working together as we engage in forward-focused academic and scholarly activities.
