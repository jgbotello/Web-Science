Graduate Students

 

The Graduate School
Email: Graduateschool@odu.edu
Phone: 757-683-4885
Typically, in graduate studies, a student's advisor is their Graduate Program Director (GPD). The GPD plays a pivotal role in assisting students with various aspects of their academic path. They guide the student to develop a comprehensive plan or course of study tailored to their academic and professional goals.
Moreover, the GPD serves as a valuable resource for students facing challenges such as academic probation or suspension. In such instances, the GPD can offer guidance on how to address issues, regain academic standing, and create a roadmap for success.
