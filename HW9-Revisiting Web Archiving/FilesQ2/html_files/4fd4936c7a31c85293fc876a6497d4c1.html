    Unable to list & no support


I really want to love this app. It is amazing when Iâm acquiring inventory making it so much easier to see whether something is profitable. And then I discovered that I had the ability to list right then and there. I just came into a huge estate buy of over 4000 books so any way I can make my life easier I will. So the first book no problem but everything after wonât list. So I contacted support who was not helpful, letting me know that I can list from a desktop computer. *sigh*. Anyway I guess Iâll have to keep at it till someone can really help me. Fix that part and Iâll be happy to give it 5 stars

    Good start...More features please


A year later and some of the things I pointed out in my previous review (below) has been taken care of, like seeing all inventory and opening cases. However, we need to see seller feedback reviews. Repricing via inventory page isnât helpful especially when you have items on sale because it only shows the lowest price and buy box price. If your item is on sale it only shows your original price against the lowest price (which could be your sale price, but you wonât know unless you log into seller central via browser). We should also be able to put items on sale from the inventory page. A lite version of Reports would be awesome...At least being able to see the comparison to last yearâs numbers.  I love the addition of the product photo studio and B2B Central. Previous Review:I use this app all day, but it needs more features. We need to be able to see all inventory, reprice, check seller reviews and open cases.

    Great app, needs two things added


Really like the app, great easy way to check my account, especially to keep up with customer messages. The two things I would really like added would be PPC monitoring and ability to modify. Also I would like to be able to modify sale prices, currently I can only modify the regular item price, which doesn't help me when I want to run a sale or modify a sale. Otherwise it is great. The app actually has something that I can't get on the web app- I can filter messages to see all received messages. This is awesome for following up on customer messages that I may not have gotten a response on in a while or something. On the web app I cannot find those conversations back easily if I send several other messages out in the mean time. That would be nice to pull from the phone app and get in the web app functionality.
