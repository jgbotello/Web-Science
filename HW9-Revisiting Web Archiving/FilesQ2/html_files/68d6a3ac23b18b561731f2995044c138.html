Wave Day Pass

The $2 fare entitles you to one hour of unlimited rides! Don’t forget, with Earn As You Go, you will never pay more than the cost of a Day Pass in a day or the value of a Monthly Pass in a calendar month. You do not have to pre-purchase a Day Pass or Monthly Pass.
Children under five years old ride free when accompanied by an adult (limit of three children per adult).
*Cash fares are exact change only. Drivers cannot make change.
**You can load a digital Monthly Pass onto your Wave smart card or mobile app for that calendar month up until the 16th of that month. Monthly Passes purchased on the 17th or after are valid for the next calendar month.
