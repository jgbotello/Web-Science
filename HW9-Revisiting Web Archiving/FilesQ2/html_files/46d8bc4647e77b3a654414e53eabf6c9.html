Vendor Guide













for Vendors, Contractors & Suppliers
Old Dominion University's enrollment of approximately 24,000 students is comprised of students attending classes on the Norfolk campus, the Peninsula and Virginia Beach Higher Education Centers, the Tri-Cities Center, and via 55 Teletechnet distance learning satellite locations.
As a state-assisted institution of higher education, Old Dominion University abides by the Rules Governing Procurement of Goods, Services, Procurement and Construction by a Public Institution of Higher Education (RULES); the Memoranda of Understanding between the University and the Commonwealth; the University's Procurement Manual; and remains in substantial compliance with the Commonwealth of Virginia Purchasing Manual for Institutions of Higher Education.
Old Dominion University's Department of Procurement Services administers the University's procurement for all goods, services, and construction. Procurement Services also serves Old Dominion by acting as liaison between contractors/suppliers and University departments.
