            Special Feature: ODU Faces of NASA
      


Astronauts may be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of NASA, but these five ODU alumni are reminders that it takes a variety of expertise to pursue the federal agency’s overall mission: to explore the unknown in air and space, innovate for the benefit of humanity and inspire the world through discovery.
Hundreds of Monarchs work at NASA facilities across the country, many in ODU’s backyard at NASA Langley Research Center or at NASA Wallops Flight Center on Virginia’s Eastern Shore. Proximity keeps the connection between ODU and NASA strong, these alumni say, but so does a shared mutual curiosity and drive to seek solutions to pressing issues and push the envelope of possibility.
