If you post content that encourages other users to violate our Terms of Service, the content may be removed, your account may be penalized, and in some cases your account may be terminated.
Posting previously removed content, or content from terminated or restricted creators
Posting content previously removed for violating our Terms of Service, content from creators with a current channel restriction, or content from creators who have been terminated is considered circumvention under our Terms of Service.
If you post such content, it may be removed, and your YouTube channel may also be penalized or terminated. This may also apply to other channels you own.
