                        I knew as a kid that I wanted to do something that would help. Through engineering, I‚Äôve found a way where I can help make infrastructure safe and reliable.

                        I want to be a renowned woman in the sports industry ‚Äì not for the money or the fame. I want to make changes. I want to make sports more accessible.

                        I have more responsibilities than most college students but I have the ability to manage them a lot better.

                        There‚Äôs no way I could‚Äôve gotten through school without me being able to fit my schedule around my life.

Meet Safiou 

















                        ODU is the stepping stone into my future career. ODU‚Äôs organizations, events and faculty have helped me feel confident that I will succeed in my career after college.

                        I came here to be a scientist, but I never imagined how ODU could be more than a university. It has been a place for me to learn and grow‚Ä¶

                        Just because I‚Äôm not on campus doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt be involved. ‚Ä¶ As I always say, I am on a mission to bring people together, and my time at ODU has allowed for me to do just that.

                        At ODU, learning doesn‚Äôt just take place in the classroom. It happens behind the camera, on stage, in the production room, or anywhere your major takes you. ‚Ä¶ I finally have 'my thing'.
