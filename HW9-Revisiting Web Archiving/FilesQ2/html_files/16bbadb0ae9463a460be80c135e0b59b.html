As the largest and most diverse college on campus, the College of Arts and Letters serves as a core

            Message from the Dean
          



 
Faculty, staff, students, alumni, and friends:
Thanks for your interest in ODU's College of Arts and Letters — a place where scholarship, innovation, creativity and the pursuit of social justice converge to change lives and strengthen communities.
I'm proud to lead the largest college within Old Dominion University, and not just because it's an honor to guide this robust, multifaceted organization. I get to see, almost every day, how knowledge and experience transform our students. I see how they, in turn, use their understanding and vision to shape a better future for our region, our Commonwealth, and our nation.
Another perk: I get to shout encouragement and praise from the sidelines as our faculty distinguish themselves through research, programming, and artistic excellence. ODU's reputation for leadership in many facets of the College of Arts and Letters is growing. That's a joy to see. For evidence, continue browsing this site.
Of course, this kind of progress can't happen in a vacuum. We get invaluable guidance from the college's Executive Advisory Board whose investments of time and imagination create amazing opportunities.
I'm also fortunate to work with donors who support our mission to educate, illuminate, and engage. If you contribute, we cannot thank you enough for helping our student achieve their dreams.
Arts and Letters is diverse both in terms of our students and the subjects we teach. One of the university's core values is accessibility. We take that goal seriously and build an inclusive culture as we search for new ways to open doors to prospective students.
Finally, I want to say how lucky I am to work with such a remarkable team. The college's staff and faculty strive for excellence and gracefully clear the obstacles that inevitably arise.
Together, we put students on course to success. With Monarchs in the lead, our future is in good hands.
Laura Delbrugge
Dean
