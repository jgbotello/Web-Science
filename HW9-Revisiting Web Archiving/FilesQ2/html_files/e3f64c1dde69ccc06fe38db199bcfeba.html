Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion
At ODU we believe that diversity and inclusion is an indispensable part of the experience for members of our campus community. Since the inception of the Inclusive Excellence Framework (IEF) and the establishment of the President's Task Force on Inclusive Excellence (PTFIE or Task Force) in 2014, a series of initiatives have been implemented to advance diversity and inclusion on our campus and throughout the Hampton Roads community. As a result of the institutional commitment toward diversity and inclusion, as well as intentional strategic planning, ODU has become an exemplar in higher education.
