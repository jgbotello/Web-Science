The youtube-ios-player-helper is an open source library that helps you embed a
        YouTube iframe player into an iOS application. The library creates a
        WebView and a bridge between your application’s Objective-C code and the
        YouTube player’s JavaScript code, thereby allowing the iOS application to control the
        YouTube player. This article describes the steps to install the library and get started
        using it from your iOS application.


Installation
This article assumes you have created a new Single View Application iOS project targeting
        the latest version of iOS, and that you add the following files when creating the
        project:

Main.storyboard
ViewController.h
ViewController.m

You can install the library via
        CocoaPods or by copying the library
        and source files from the
        project’s GitHub page.

The library is available to install via CocoaPods. Alternatively, the library and source
          files are available via the project’s GitHub page and can be copied into an existing
          project.


Install the library via CocoaPods
If your project uses CocoaPods, add the line below to your Podfile to install the library.
        In that line, replace x.y.z with the latest pod version, which will be
        identified on the project’s GitHub page.
pod "youtube-ios-player-helper", "~> x.y.z"
At the command line prompt, type pod install to update your workspace with the
        dependencies.
Tip: Remember that when using CocoaPods, you must open the .xcworkspace file
        in Xcode, not the .xcodeproj file.
Check out the CocoaPods
        tutorial to learn more.


Manually install the library
To install the helper library manually, either download the source via
        GitHub’s download link or
        clone the repository. Once you have a local copy of the code, follow these steps:

Open the sample project in Xcode or Finder.
Select YTPlayerView.h, YTPlayerView.m, and the
          Assets folder. If you open the workspace in Xcode, these are available
          under Pods -> Development Pods -> YouTube-Player-iOS-Helper and
          Pods -> Development Pods -> YouTube-Player-iOS-Helper -> Resources. In the Finder,
          these are available in the project's root directory in the Classes and
          Assets directories.
Drag these files and folders into your project. Make sure the Copy items into
          destination group’s folder option is checked. When dragging the Assets folder, make
          sure that the Create Folder References for any added folders option is
          checked.


The library should now be installed.


Add a YTPlayerView via Interface Builder or the Storyboard
To add a YTPlayerView via Interface Builder or the Storyboard:

      

Drag a UIView instance onto your View.


Select the Identity Inspector and change the class of the view to
            YTPlayerView.


Open ViewController.h and add the following header:
#import “YTPlayerView.h”
Also add the following property:
@property(nonatomic, strong) IBOutlet YTPlayerView *playerView;


In Interface Builder, create a connection from the View element that you defined in the
            previous step to your View Controller's playerView property.


Now open ViewController.m and add the following code to the end of your
            viewDidLoad method:
[self.playerView loadWithVideoId:@"M7lc1UVf-VE"];


Build and run your application. When the video thumbnail loads, tap the video thumbnail to
        launch the fullscreen video player.


Control video playback
The ViewController::loadWithVideoId: method has a variant,
        loadWithVideoId:playerVars:, that allows developers to pass additional player
        variables to the view. These player variables correspond to the
        player parameters in the
          IFrame Player API. The playsinline parameter enables the video to play
        directly in the view rather than playing fullscreen. When a video is playing inline, the
        containing iOS application can programmatically control playback.
Replace the loadWithVideoId: call with this code:
NSDictionary *playerVars = @{
  @"playsinline" : @1,
};
[self.playerView loadWithVideoId:@"M7lc1UVf-VE" playerVars:playerVars];
Open up the storyboard or Interface Builder. Drag two buttons onto your View, labeling them
        Play and Stop. Open ViewController.h and add these methods, which
        will be mapped to the buttons:
- (IBAction)playVideo:(id)sender;
- (IBAction)stopVideo:(id)sender;
Now open ViewController.m and define these two functions:
- (IBAction)playVideo:(id)sender {
  [self.playerView playVideo];
}

- (IBAction)stopVideo:(id)sender {
  [self.playerView stopVideo];
}
Most of the IFrame Player API functions have Objective-C equivalents, though some of the
        naming may differ slightly to more closely match Objective-C coding guidelines. Notable
        exceptions are methods controlling the volume of the video, since these are controlled by
        the phone hardware or with built in UIView instances designed for this purpose,
        such as MPVolumeView.
Open your storyboard or Interface Builder and control-drag to connect the Play and
        Stop buttons to the playVideo: and stopVideo: methods.
Now build and run the application. Once the video thumbnail loads, you should be able to
        play and stop the video using native controls in addition to the player controls.


Handle player callbacks
It can be useful to programmatically handle playback events, such as playback state changes
        and playback errors. In the JavaScript API, this is done with
        event listeners.
        In Objective-C,this is done with a
        delegate.
The following code shows how to update the interface declaration in
        ViewController.h so the class conforms to the delegate protocol. Change
        ViewController.h’s interface declaration as follows:
@interface ViewController : UIViewController<YTPlayerViewDelegate>
YTPlayerViewDelegate is a protocol for handling playback events in the player.
        To update ViewController.m to handle some of the events, you first need to set
        the ViewController instance as the delegate of the YTPlayerView
        instance. To make this change, add the following line to the viewDidLoad method
        in ViewController.h.
self.playerView.delegate = self;
Now add the following method to ViewController.m:
- (void)playerView:(YTPlayerView *)playerView didChangeToState:(YTPlayerState)state {
  switch (state) {
    case kYTPlayerStatePlaying:
      NSLog(@"Started playback");
      break;
    case kYTPlayerStatePaused:
      NSLog(@"Paused playback");
      break;
    default:
      break;
  }
}
Build and run the application. Watch the log output in Xcode as the player state changes.
        You should see updates when the video is played or stopped.
The library provides the constants that begin with the kYT* prefix for
        convenience and readability. For a full list of these constants, look at
        YTPlayerView.m.


Best practices and limitations
The library builds on top of the IFrame Player API by creating a WebView and
        rendering the HTML and JavaScript required for a basic player. The library's goal is to be
        as easy-to-use as possible, bundling methods that developers frequently have to write into a
        package. There are a few limitations that should be noted:

The library does not support concurrent video playback in multiple
          YTPlayerView instances. If your application has multiple
          YTPlayerView instances, a recommended best practice is to pause or stop
          playback in any existing instances before starting playback in a different instance. In
          the example application that ships with the project, the ViewControllers make use of
          NSNotificationCenter to dispatch notifications that playback is about to
          begin. Other ViewControllers are notified and will pause playback in their
          YTPlayerView instances.
Reuse your existing, loaded YTPlayerView instances when possible. When a
          video needs to be changed in a View, don't create a new UIView instance or a
          new YTPlayerView instance, and don't call either loadVideoId: or
          loadPlaylistId:. Instead, use the
          cueVideoById:startSeconds: family of functions, which do not
          reload the WebView. There is a noticeable delay when loading the entire
          IFrame player.
This player cannot play private videos, but it can play
          unlisted videos. Since this
          library wraps the existing iframe player, the player's behavior should be nearly identical
          to that of a player embedded on a webpage in a mobile browser.
