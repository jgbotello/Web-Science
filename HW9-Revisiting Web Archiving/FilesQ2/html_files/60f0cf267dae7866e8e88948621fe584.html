Social Mobility










Social mobility in higher education refers to the ability of individuals, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, to improve their socioeconomic status through educational opportunities. It encompasses the process of moving from a lower income or social class to a higher one by acquiring education, skills, and opportunities that enable personal and financial growth.
Old Dominion University (ODU) is committed to promoting social mobility through various initiatives that support students from diverse backgrounds in achieving academic success and advancing their futures.

            Student Testimonials
      






Brad Lee ' 21








I'm a nontraditional low-income student with physical disabilities, and ODU's social mobility mission has played a key role in helping me overcome educational disadvantages. As a first-generation college student, I want to give my son the legacy of education. ODU has been a catalyst in allowing me to achieve my goals.
Tina Santee, Psychology Major
