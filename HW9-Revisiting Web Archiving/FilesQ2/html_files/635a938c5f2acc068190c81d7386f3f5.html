RIPTA to Close Historic East Side Tunnel for Construction Beginning Monday, March 25, 2024
Routes 1, 32, 33, 34, 40 and 61x will be on detour
The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA) announced today that the East Side Tunnel will be closed for repairs and renovations starting Monday, March 25, 2024. Construction is expected to last through mid-September. Routes 1, 32, 33, 34, 40 and 61x will be on detour beginning Monday, March 25, 2024, through mid-September to accommodate East Side Tunnel construction. The Tunnel will be closed for repairs during that time.
This critical piece of transit infrastructure was built in 1914 to help former trolley lines reach the top of College Hill as they traveled from downtown Providence to the East Side and beyond. The tunnel is still a vital connector today, allowing buses to avoid the steep incline of College Hill.
