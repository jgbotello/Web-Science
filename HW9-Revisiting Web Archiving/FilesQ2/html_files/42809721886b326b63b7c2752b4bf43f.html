A Sample Law Assignment and Solution on Various Types of Law
Question:
Discuss the different aspects of the law covered in first-year law school contract law.
Answer:
Introduction
Maintenance of law is necessary to consider ethical behavior and morality in society. Different laws are enforced in the constitutions of different countries, to help the society to behave properly.  Individual and social welfare is maintained by considering the laws and regulations.
This course study illustrates different aspects of laws about organizations and individuals. In addition to that, this critique highlights the impact and influence of laws on different businesses. Moreover, a discussion on different case studies, about the contract, and criminal and tort laws are also focused. On the other hand, this study demonstrates different elements of laws, about organizations and individuals.
Introduction to law
Laws are considered as the restrictions, rules, and regulations, which are applied to different and overall individuals of society. In the view of Gifford & Jones (2016), the main purpose of a law is to help individuals to conduct and behave themselves properly. In addition to that, a law helps individuals to deter and sanction improper behavior. On the other hand, Robbennolt & Hans (2016) has commented that right infringements along with maintenance of order and safety can be passed by considering the laws made by the constitution. Moreover, society and individuals can be protected from maintaining the rules and laws made by the legislation. In the opinion of Ferrara et al. (2016), laws are formed through parliament representatives along with independent judges and courts.
Different laws and rules can be accessed by individuals in terms of protection. However, as Lauterwein (2016) has stated that basically, two primary laws are there, which are civil law and criminal law. Civil laws are considered as the laws, which help to deal with the concerned disputes, between the concerned parties. On the other hand, as Engle (2014) has mentioned that criminal law deals with offenses, which are made against morality, people, and property. Common welfare can be gained by the individual through maintaining laws and regulations. From the viewpoint of Gifford & Jones (2016), the system of law is formed and enforced with the help of governmental institutions and social institutions, to regulate the behavior properly. In addition to that, laws and regulations are incorporated in different businesses, organizations, and individuals to avoid any risks or infringement cases.

Online Australian Law Assignment Help in Important Disciplines of Law
The law of Australia is different from the UK legal system; however, we can see a reflection of UK law in the foundation of the Australian legal system. All self-governing states and territories in Australia are separate jurisdictions. These states have their court systems and legislatures. Each state's legal systems influence but do not bind one another. Laws passed by the Parliament of Australia apply to the whole of Australia. Let us explore the Australian legal system in detail. Below are the various laws that are prevalent in Australia. If you are having difficulty understanding all of Australia's legal systems, please contact us. We provide a hassle-free law assignment essay writing service at a reasonable cost. 


Australian administrative law: There are various administrative agencies in Australia, and all of them have some authority and power. The shift toward privatization and deregulation has influenced administrative law applications over the last few decades. Administrative Appeals Tribunals are a distinct feature of the Australian legal system. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act of 1975 established the aforementioned hybrid of a court and an administrative agency. The major changes that were introduced with the inception of AAT were the availability of review on the merits and the right to obtain reasons for decisions. There are many states and territories in Australia that have similar tribunals to the AAT. A few of the territories are Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia, and Queensland. The most recent tribunals were established in Queensland in 2009.

Family law in Australia: It is codified in various pieces of legislation, but it also includes common law and equity laws. It mainly deals with the family and the relationships between those people, including when those relationships end. Every Australian territory has a de facto agreement in place. New South Wales has a de facto name for the domestic relationship. Similarly, other Australian states, including Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, have their own de facto standards for family and relationships.

Copyright Law of Australia: The Australian Copyright Act 1968 covers the scope of copyright in Australia. This act makes national law applicable throughout Australia. Copyright law in Australia is a federal law established by the Australian parliament. Every possible case of copyright infringement is covered under Australian copyright law. To learn more about copyright law, please get in touch with our tutors. If you need help with an assignment, please fill out the online assignment submission form. We will respond in less than fifteen minutes to answer your query and solve your assignment-related problem.

Taxation Law in Australia: To run any business in Australia, one must learn all aspects of Australian business taxes. Most of the major business taxes, like income tax, are collected and sanctioned by the Australian government through the office of the Australian Tax Office (ATO). In some cases, states also impose additional duties and taxes, most commonly the payroll tax. The country of Australia holds several tax treaties with other economies to prevent double-layered taxation of foreign entities that are currently operating in Australia. Business law involves taxes such as goods and services tax (GST), capital gains tax (CGT), and personal income tax. Concerning employment law, most of the personal income tax is paid by the employer. The employer or head of an organization subtracts the needed level of tax from an employee's monthly salary before it is credited to the employee's account. Apart from taxation law, Australia also has a tax agreement with more than 40 countries. These agreements and treaties are founded to prevent double taxation and enhance cooperation between international tax authorities.

Tort law: A tort is a civil wrong other than a breach of contract. There are a large number of torts in place to correct any form of conduct or wrong. Tort derives its legal status from the common law. The Australian perspective on tort law is influenced by UK law. However, the recent Australian High Court decision has demonstrated a strong preference for US principles. A few of the common torts in Australian law are trespasses, breaches of public and statutory duties, international damage to economic interests, breaking civil law, and occupation and possession of the land.


The criminal law of Australia: Individual jurisdictions in the Commonwealth of Australia administer the criminal law of Australia. The foundation of Australian criminal law is English common law, which has been evolving in the Australian courts. There is a significant inconsistency among the states when we talk about criminal law. The Australian territory had undergone reforms and adopted the Model Criminal Code to remove this inconsistency. New South Wales, Western Australia, and the Northern Territory have participated in modifying some crimes to match the positions in the model criminal code. However, in many areas, states have not changed their laws to reflect this code, and in some instances, they have rejected the code entirely.
