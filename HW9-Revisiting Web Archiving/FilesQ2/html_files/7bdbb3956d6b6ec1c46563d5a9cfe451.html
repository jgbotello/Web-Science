What is the Downtown Transit Connector?
The Downtown Transit Connector provides high-frequency transit service (every 5 minutes in each direction) between the Providence Amtrak/MBTA Station and the Hospital District in Upper South Providence. There are six paired stops along the corridor, each designed with a unique and highly-visible identity. The stops feature shelters, real-time bus arrival signage, and other passenger amenities. RIPTA service in this corridor has been enhanced using signal priority for buses and dedicated bus lanes, as well as attractive public spaces around DTC stops.
The $17 million project is funded by RIPTA and a USDOT Transportation Investments Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant awarded to the City of Providence in 2014. Part of the funding was used by RIPTA to purchase vehicles to operate the service.

NEWS & EVENTS


DTC Construction
Construction activity began in August 2018 and will be complete in 2020. Station infrastructure in Kennedy Plaza and at Providence Station will be added at later dates, as part of future projects planned in these areas.


DTC Groundbreaking – August 24, 2018
RIPTA CEO Scott Avedisian welcomed the entire RI Congressional delegation and Providence Mayor Elorza to mark the official start of construction on the Downtown Transit Connector (DTC). Avedisian noted the DTC will “create a spine across the City of Providence to move people effectively and efficiently.” The project is largely being funded by a federal USDOT TIGER grant, with construction continuing through 2019.

Project Map
The DTC serves six stops in four downtown Providence neighborhoods: the Hospital District, the Jewelry District, Downcity and Capital Center. Service will be operated by regular RIPTA routes run along the corridor via Eddy Street, Dorrance Street, Kennedy Plaza and Exchange Street. Routes 51, 54, 55, 58 and 72 were extended south beyond Kennedy Plaza to RI Hospital, and Routes 3 and 4 were also extended north to Providence Station. Weekday frequencies have also been increased to ensure a combined 5 minute service frequency along the DTC corridor.
DTC stops are located at: 1) RI Hospital; 2) Eddy Street at South Street Landing; 3) Dyer Street at Ship Street; 4) Dorrance Street at Weybosett/Pine; 5) Kennedy Plaza; and 6) Providence Station. Service in the corridor only stops at these stations. Designated bus and bike lanes have been added along certain segments and green lights will be extended for oncoming buses to help the speed and reliability of transit.
