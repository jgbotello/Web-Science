Lawyer in Train(ing)





 The journey to becoming a lawyer can be a long one, with articling being one of the countless trains we have to take.Hop aboard while I take you through the many stops you will make during your articling period.First stop, PleadingsVillePleadings are the main documents in a lawsuit that the court requires the parties to file at the beginning of a case. These typically include a statement of claim and a statement of defence. As an articling student, I drafted pleadings and saw how a lawsuit begins. Whether I am drafting a claim for a plaintiff, or defending a claim, I am able to identify the key facts and issues to make the case. Next stop, The Township of Affidavits Lawyers will typically gather all the evidence in their client’s possession and compile it into an Affidavit of Documents to exchange it with the other party. When tasked with drafting an Affidavit of Documents, I start by reading the statement of claim and defence to get familiar with the case. Then I sort the documents into 3 categories, i) relevant, ii) privileged, and iii) not relevant. All the relevant documents are produced and included in the Affidavit under Schedule A. While all the privileged documents, such as communications between the lawyer and the client, go into Schedule B. When it is challenging to identify the relevance of a particular document, I reach out to the assigning lawyer for clarification. Next Stop, The City of DreamsThis is where all aspiring lawyers aim to go. No, not New York City, Courthouse City. Going to court is an essential part of the articling experience. While a majority of court appearances are now virtual, there are still some opportunities to attend court in person. Whether I am observing and diligently taking notes or making a submission, going to court is the most exciting part of my articling experience. I have been given many opportunities to sit in on discoveries, mediations, settlement conferences, and pre-trials. It’s always interesting to hear the opposing party’s submissions and watch how the case unfolds. These are just a few of the many stops you will make during your articling period. While articling can be a challenging journey to navigate, especially for new law school graduates, there are several conductors on this train to help make this transition as smooth as possible. Ashley, Student Director, is one of many people who ensure students have the best experience possible.  by Annie J.

Staying Organized as an Articling Student





The transition from life as a law student to an articling student comes with a steep learning
curve. Aside from the 12-week summer student term – which flies by in the blink of an eye – articling is the first real glimpse into the life of a practicing lawyer.In my first three weeks with multiple assignments on the go
at once and field trips scheduled by mentoring lawyers, and Ashley Faust,
Student Director, I realized staying organized is crucial for both my success
as an articling student and the success of the firm’s clients. These are the methods
that have helped me stay organized.
Recording Assignment Details –
Immediately!
At MB, our main source of assignments is the “list”, an email group
where lawyers send tasks to all articling students. The firm is busy, so the
list often moves quickly. To keep track of all my assignments, when a new
assignment comes in, I immediately record important details on a spreadsheet
provided by Ashley, including a breakdown of the tasks to be completed, the assigning
lawyer, the client file number, and the due date. I then track my progress using a
light system: green indicates I’m currently working on the assignment, yellow
indicates I am awaiting feedback on the draft I’ve submitted, and red indicates my
work has been approved. This system helps me manage deadlines to ensure nothing
slips through the cracks.
Filing Emails
Whether it is messages from lawyers and
clients, conflict checks, or updates about firm social events, managing the
high volume of emails is challenging. To help stay organized, I create separate
email folders for each new assignment. This allows me to file related emails
into the appropriate folder, ensuring that all correspondence for an assignment
is neatly recorded and easily accessible.>
Diarize Field Trips & Due Dates
MB prioritizes hands-on
learning for articling students, so we attend several “field trips”. In the
first few weeks of the articling term, I’ve already been scheduled to attend a
mediation, an examination for discovery, a pre-trial conference, a motion, and an
application. Using Outlook calendar, I diarize my field trips and set up reminders 3-4 days in advance. This gives me time to contact the lawyer
for instructions and to review the file before attending. Proper scheduling allows
me to organize assignment due dates around these field trips. 
Establishing
good habits as an articling student will make me more successful as a lawyer -- when
organization and time management are even more crucial. After all, failing to
keep track of deadlines as a lawyer could result in serious consequences, such
as missed limitation periods, or a client being noted in default. Being
organized also helps reduce stress because I know everything is
accounted for and I have ample time to complete my
assignments.
However, no matter how hard
I try to stay organized, I know things will come up to throw my plans out of whack. In those situations, it is extremely
comforting to have a supportive MB team around me. Whether
it is reaching out to Ashley for advice on managing competing deadlines or
calling over the cubicle to ask another articling student for
assistance, I know there will always be someone ready and willing to
help in any way they can. by Draeden L.

Balancing Life as a Personal Trainer turned Law Student





 As a law student and personal trainer, I knew transitioning from student life to a professional environment would be challenging. How would I balance my time between a demanding job, getting to the gym, and staying on top of my nutrition? Would I have to forgo all social events and personal activities I enjoy? Definitely not! 
Balancing the demands of law with my passion for fitness has taught me invaluable lessons about maintaining both physical and mental health. This summer, my strategy for staying healthy, and productive included finding ways to eat nutritiously on busy days, doing exercises that alleviated pain from sitting at a desk, and creating routines to reduce stress. Prioritizing Healthy Eating
One of the biggest changes in my life was the shift in my eating habits. Working in law is demanding, and it’s easy to fall into the trap of convenience foods. However, I’ve found that maintaining a healthy diet is crucial for both my energy levels and mental clarity. When I haven't the time to make lunch, I choose“healthier” on-the-go food choices at my favourite coffee shop!
Stretches and Exercises for Back and Neck Pain Spending long hours studying or working at a computer takes a toll on my back and neck. These are the stretches I do regularly to prevent pain.
Reducing Stress
I found creating a structured daily routine is one of the best ways to achieve success. It helps me get clear on my priorities, organize my time, and boost productivity. To make the most out of my 24 hours and limit procrastination, planning my day allows me to stay focused on my goals and direct my attention to the important things that I can control.
These are the things I considered when creating a productive schedule:
Morning Routine: I start my day with a healthy breakfast and a quick workout to boost my energy and focus.Work and Study Blocks: I set specific times for working, ensuring I stay on track with my assignments.Breaks and Physical Activity: I incorporate short breaks and physical activity throughout the day to keep my mind and body fresh.Evening Wind Down: I dedicate time in the evening to relax and unwind, which helps me maintain a healthy work-life balance.
Finding Balance
In conclusion, change is inevitable and isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Success depends on how I choose to approach the circumstances changing around me. Balancing a career in law has its challenges, but with the right routine and mindset, it’s possible to do less and achieve more.I also found inspiration reading the ultimate self-help book, "Atomic Habits" by James Clear. It's infamous for a reason and it’s included in the Spotify Premium membership. So, grab your headphones and get walking!by Zlata B.

Buckle Up… We’re going on a Field Trip!





When I originally looked at firms participating in the Ottawa recruitment, the first quality that stood out about MB was their commitment to students for hands-on participation in all areas of civil litigation. This was reiterated in every step of the interview process starting with OCI’s and all the way to in-firm interviews. Everyone kept going on about the ‘field trips’. While this was an intriguing aspect and something that certainly drew me to the firm, I still never expected to have so many ‘field trips’ available to me in my summer term (and it’s not even over yet!)

During our first week, Ashley, the Student Director, set up guided visits to the Ottawa and Toronto courthouse libraries. By the end of the second week, she had started coordinating appearances so that we could witness various steps in the civil litigation process!

My first ‘field trip’ – assigned to me from “The List” – was a two-day examination for discoveries on a commercial litigation file. I had no expectation of how the two days would go, and although it was much faster-paced than I had expected, I still learned a lot about the process. Then, I had the opportunity to attend discoveries for an MVA file. Having previously attended the commercial lit discovery, I thought I knew what I was walking into. But because it was another lawyer and a different type of law, it was completely different than the first one!

I have also had the opportunity to attend a mediation, where I spoke directly with an adjuster from an insurance company about their role in the process. I've also sat in on calls with clients when they’re being prepared for discoveries, and I have attended case conferences with judges! 

Seeing how different lawyers approach various steps of the litigation process has been an unforgettable start to my legal career and an invaluable and unique way to learn about the legal profession. One of my biggest takeaways so far this summer is that every ‘field trip’ is different, and I will undoubtedly learn something new from each one I attend!

Finding my Sea Legs





I am working on a file that involves admiralty law, a practice area I had hoped to encounter this summer. What interests me about admiralty law is its reach and impact span every corner of the globe. Where there is water, there is shipping, where there is shipping, there are contracts, and where there are contracts, there are terms limiting liability. That's the prominent takeaway from my work on this assignment (so far anyway).

The incident at hand is not exactly a marine disaster, but it involves the carriage of goods by sea, nonetheless. The assignment has me feeling as though one part of me is on solid ground, while another is adrift at sea. It’s not as though I’ve capsized in a hurricane, it’s more of an issue of finding my sea legs.

Although Admiralty Law 101 is not a course offered at my school, I waded into the waters as best I could. Questions on my mind included: what are the relevant statutes, what are customary practices of the trade, what is a “bill of lading,” what happens in case of conflict of laws, and does this specific issue exist in the case law? After scouring the depths of WestLaw and Canlii, I felt as though I had assembled a watertight understanding of how the issue could be dealt with.

I completed what I thought I was supposed to do and met with the assigning lawyer, eager to discuss my findings. While I may have been on the right tack (pun intended), the lawyer’s words took the wind out of my sails: "Does this help our client?”  In other words, all the research I immersed myself in may have been on point, but was it useful to the case? That's the sort of reframing I needed. 

I suppose this is what my law professors have been implying when they have said “You need to learn to think like a lawyer.” As in, it’s one thing to “know” the law, but it’s another thing entirely to apply it in practice. Though it would be nice to learn as much as possible about this area of law, it's not practical. More importantly, it's not helpful. I am grateful for this interaction, as it helped me chart a new course of research on the matter. In the future, I will formulate a more concise research question before diving in.

While I may not land on the other side of this assignment as a decorated maritime lawyer, I have been exposed to an area of practice I would not otherwise have encountered in law school. I'm glad that my summer experience has so quickly expanded my legal lexicon, and I have my eyes trained on the horizon for more of these experiences.by Joseph C.
