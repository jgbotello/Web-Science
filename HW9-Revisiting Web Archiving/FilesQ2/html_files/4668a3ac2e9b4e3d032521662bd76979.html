Frank Reidy Research Center for Bioelectrics










 
I warmly welcome you to the website of the Frank Reidy Research Center for Bioelectrics (FRRCBE) at Old Dominion University. FRRCBE was founded in 2002 by Karl Schoenbach, one of the pioneers of Bioelectrics, for interdisciplinary research, innovation, and education in an uncharted territory of ultra-short pulse and plasma effects on the living matter. The Center mission is to increase scientific knowledge of the interaction of electric fields and ionized gases with biological cells towards the development of medical diagnostics, therapeutics, and environmental applications. With more than 50 issued U.S. patents and over 600 publications in peer-reviewed journals, the Center is a global leader in advancing the field of bioelectrics.
The Center is the lead organization in the International Bioelectrics Consortium, an association of 18 research institutions from the US, Europe, and Asia. We welcome collaborations and offer training in unique bioelectric technologies to both students and seasoned investigators. Thank you visiting our website, and we will be glad to hear from you.

Core Facilities

















Conventional pulsed power applications in biology and medicine have a long history, going back three centuries to Galvani, Volta, and Franklin (Benjamin), and even much earlier. Karl Schoenbach, working here at ODU, drawing on his experience in plasma physics and engineering, began in the 1990s with Stephen Beebe and colleagues at Eastern Virginia Medical School applying to biomedical targets a different kind of pulsed power: very high electric fields — megavolts per meter — for very short times — nanoseconds (billionths of a second). In doing so, he brought together the people and resources required to create a new multi-disciplinary field that includes physicists, engineers, cell and molecular biologists, and physicians.
