Gratitude in the iSchool Community: What We’re Thankful For




Published: November 25, 2024 by Gabe Farmer





  As Thanksgiving approaches, it’s a perfect time to reflect on
  what we’re thankful for. In the iSchool, we’re more than just a
  group of students, faculty and staff scattered across the globe.
  We’re a community! Whether it’s the program’s flexibility, our
  inspiring peers and faculty or the connections we’ve built,
  there’s a lot to be grateful for. I reached out to fellow
  students to hear what they’re thankful for, and their responses
  highlight the incredible strength and support within our
  community.

Balancing Life, Work and School – Spotlighting Corrine’s Journey







Published: November 19, 2024 by Gabe Farmer


  Online education can feel isolating, but the iSchool community
  spans the globe. We’re not alone in our studies, stresses or
  struggles. Across time zones and life stages, there are hundreds
  of students we can celebrate, commiserate or collaborate with.
  For this reason, I present a “Day in the Life” series that will
  highlight some relatable iSchool students. The feature will offer
  insights into how students from all walks of life balance the
  program with their day-to-day lives and shine a light on our
  shared experiences.

Navigating the E-Portfolio Process: Tips, Tricks and Tales from the Trenches



 


Published: November 13, 2024 by Gabe Farmer


  Are you nearing the finish line of your MLIS program? Is the
  infamous e-Portfolio
  looming large on your to-do list? You’re not alone, you don’t
  have to look far to find fellow students nervous about the
  e-Portfolio process. To help demystify the process, I chatted
  with 
  Dr. Michael Stephens, SJSU iSchool professor, and two fellow
  students, Ellie Keene and Rose Harless, who are currently in the
  final stages of the e-Portfolio process.

Top 5 Cybersecurity Tips for iSchool Students




Published: October 28, 2024 by Gabe Farmer





  Cybersecurity Awareness


  October is known for spooky tales, but what could be scarier in
  today’s digital age than having your personal information stolen?
  October was declared 
  Cybersecurity Awareness Month 20 years ago in 2004. In this
  digital age, we have so much of our personal information
  accessible online, but it is easy to feel a sense of anonymity on
  the internet. Maybe you have even thought, “I’m not anyone
  important, why would a hacker target me?” 
  Dr. Crystal Fausett, iSchool Assistant Professor, says this
  can be a false sense of security.

Published: October 14, 2024 by Gabe Farmer


  The San José State University iSchool provides students with a
  cornucopia of resources to help steer our course through our

  a whopping 124 links to various resources in
  just one webpage. My goal in this post is to provide a pragmatic
  and digestible guide to some of the most commonly used student
  resources.
