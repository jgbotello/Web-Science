            Faces of ODU: Ishan Perera
          
Old Dominion University junior Ishan Perera is on track to become a neurosurgeon. With a biology major and minors in chemistry and computer science, Ishan wants to make a difference in the lives of hospital patients. Through hands-on classroom experiences in ODU’s Human Cadaver Dissection course, Ishan learned the inner workings of human anatomy to prepare him for a career in medicine. Ishan is applying the skills he’s learning at ODU to his work as an emergency room technician and volunteer with the Virginia Beach EMS, the nation’s largest volunteer prehospital medical services. As a student in the Perry Honor’s College, Ishan participated in medical research and shadowed doctors and observed surgeries with local health practitioners. ODU’s metropolitan campus is in close proximity to Eastern Virginia Medical School, and level one trauma hospitals, allowing students to further their education and get jobs in the medical field after they graduate.
