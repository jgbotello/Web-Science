Assembly was a key part of continuing employee engagement throughout these difficult times. We are approaching the end of our first year with Assembly and looking forward to continuing the partnership....âShannon TownsendSales Execution Manager at Coca-ColaâWeâve been honestly surprised at the positive impact Assembly made in team camaraderie. The unique insight into who is positively impacting their colleagues and ultimately the company has been invaluable!âFarbod ShorakaCEO at Promenade Group, Inc.âAssembly has been like a âsnowball rolling down a hillâ for fostering engagement across our teams. One person sharing recognition is a catalyst for multiple team members to take a moment to recognize their coworkers contributions. That simple act of reacting to a shoutout then inspires those individuals to shoutout someone else, and all of a sudden you have a series of shoutouts flowing in.âAdam LewisCEO & Founder at ApploiâWe were looking for a way to recognize employees that was fun, easy to use, and fit our budget. Thereâs always a lot happening. We wanted a recognition program that employees could access on the fly and in the moment, and could be tied to tangible rewards.âMallory YohannanHead of People at HelloTechResource CenterStay up-to-date on Assembly and employee recognition and engagement news, trends, data, and more!Go to Resource CenterEngagement and RecognitionUnderstanding eNPS and Its Impact on Employee EngagementDiscover how an Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) measures workplace sentiment and boosts engagement.
