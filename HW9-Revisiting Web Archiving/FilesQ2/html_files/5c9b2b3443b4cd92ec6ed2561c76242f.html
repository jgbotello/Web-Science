Our Mission
The Office of Intercultural Relations' LGBTQIA+ Initiatives is the primary resource on campus for LGBTQIA+ identities. Through education, on-campus engagement and advocacy the LGBTQIA+ Initiatives strives to reduce homophobia, transphobia, and heterosexism among the Old Dominion University community and create a more affirming environment through which all Monarchs can thrive. The Safe Space Committee, an educational arm of the LGBTQIA+ Initiatives, facilitates ally certification trainings to assist in the creation of a more affirming campus by increasing LGBTQIA+ allyship among faculty/staff and students.
The LGBTQIA+ events and programs produced by OIR are made possible through collaboration with ODU Safe Space, ODU Sexuality and Gender Alliance, ODU Queer Resilience Coalition, As(t*)erisk, Women and Gender Equity Center, Health Promotions, English Department, MFA Creative Writing Program, Gay Cultural Studies, Counseling Services, Global Monarch Club, The Starving Artists and local community partners, such as the LGBT Life Center.
