Dangerous acts include, but are not limited to, any act in the categories listed under Extremely Dangerous challenges above, such as acts that risk asphyxiation or electrocution.

        
We also don’t allow content showing dangerous acts by minors. This includes content that shows minors:
            
Drinking alcohol
Using vaporizers, e-cigarettes, tobacco, or marijuana
Misusing fireworks

Violence involving children: Any real fights or violence between children. For more info, review our Child Safety policy.

Note: We may age-restrict content that has documentary or educational context.


Age-restricted content
Note: The list below isn't complete.
Sometimes content doesn't violate our policies, but it may not be appropriate for viewers under 18.
We may restrict rather than remove if content showing a dangerous act meets one or more of the following criteria:

There is educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic context, such as providing information about the risks of the act. For example, this could include context explaining the types of injuries that can happen as a result of doing the dangerous act, or describing your own experience being injured as a result of the dangerous act. It could also include context explaining the types of precautions or training required to do the act safely and prevent injury. Saying, “Don’t try this at home” is not sufficient context.
The act shown does not risk serious injury.
The content does not promote the act shown. Promotion includes any form of encouragement or praise of the act, or providing instructions on how to complete the act.

Learn about age-restricted content and how to watch age-restricted videos.

Examples of age-restricted content


Prank content featuring adults using excessive fake blood or gruesome fake injuries.
Showing footage of people engaging in a dangerous challenge, with commentary describing the number of people seriously injured by the challenge.
Content that shows adults misusing fireworks.
Content that shows adults using tasers on other willing participants or themselves.
Content that shows an adult parkour athlete reacting to videos of highly dangerous amateur stunts and commenting about the risk of harm.



Educational, documentary, scientific, or artistic content
Sometimes, content that would otherwise violate this policy is allowed to stay on YouTube when it has Educational, Documentary, Scientific, or Artistic (EDSA) context. Learn about how YouTube evaluates EDSA content.
Note: In some cases, EDSA content may be age-restricted. Certain content isn’t allowed on YouTube even if it has EDSA context added, such as content that sells drugs or regulated pharmaceuticals without a prescription.
Examples of EDSA content


A news piece on the dangers of choking games may be appropriate, but posting clips out of context from the same documentary might not be.
A video in which a professional stunt person performs a dangerous motorcycle jump that shows viewers the safety precautions taken in preparation, like onsite emergency medical personnel and the use of protective equipment.
A documentary that shows the impact of drug use in a particular community that, while showing viewers drug usage, discourages viewers from using drugs and doesn’t provide information on how to make or purchase them.
A video that shows dangerous driving or vehicle crashes in controlled environments to educate viewers about safe driving practices or vehicle safety features.



What happens if content violates this policy
If your content violates this policy, we will remove the content and send you an email to let you know. If we can’t verify that a link you post is safe, we may remove the link. Note that violative URLs posted within the video itself or in the video’s metadata may result in the video being removed.
If this is your first time violating our Community Guidelines, you'll likely get a warning with no penalty to your channel. You will have the chance to take a policy training to allow the warning to expire after 90 days. The 90 day period starts from when the training is completed, not when the warning is issued. However, if the same policy is violated within that 90 day window, the warning will not expire and your channel will be given a strike. If you violate a different policy after completing the training, you will get another warning.
If you get 3 strikes within 90 days, your channel will be terminated. Learn more about our strikes system.

We may terminate your channel or account for repeated violations of the Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. We may also terminate your channel or account after a single case of severe abuse, or when the channel is dedicated to a policy violation. We may prevent repeat offenders from taking policy trainings in the future. Learn more about channel or account terminations.
